### Abstract 

The presence of data science has been profound in the scientific community in almost every discipline. An important part of the data science education expansion has been at the undergraduate level. We conducted a systematic literature review to (1) specify current evidence and knowledge gaps in undergraduate data science education and (2) inform policymakers and data science educators/practitioners about the present status of data science education research. The majority of the publications in data science education that met our search criteria were available open-access. Our results indicate that data science education research lacks empirical data and reproducibility. Not all disciplines contribute equally to the field of data science education. Computer science and data science as a separate field emerge as the leading contributors to the literature. In contrast, fields such as statistics, mathematics, as well as other fields closely related to data science exhibit a limited presence in studies. We recommend that federal agencies and researchers 1) invest in empirical data science education research; 2) diversify research efforts to enrich the spectrum of types of studies; 3) encourage scholars in key data science fields that are currently underrepresented in the literature to contribute more to research and publications.
