Although ethical frameworks have the ability to reflect cultural priorities, a singular view of ethics, as we explore, often fails to speak to the multiple and diverse priorities held both within and across institutional spaces. To that end, this paper explores multiple perspectives, epistemologies, and worldviews that can collectively push researchers towards considerations of a data science education that is equity -minded both in concept and practice. Through a set of dialogues which examine our positionalities, journeys, ethics, local cultures, and accountabilities, this pa-per explores the contextual realities rooted in the authors' educational settings. These conversations focus on the humanity of our students, the communities from which we come from and serve, as well as the unintentional harms and possibilities associated with the development of data science programs across institutional types. We take a set of five core questions to examine how we made, and continue to make, sense of our diverse cultural perspectives on data science education and equity with/in relation to others' realities.

Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science.

 Despite the growing interest in health data science education, it is not embedded in undergraduate medical curricula and little is known about best teaching practices. This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science.
 
 
 
 Methods
 
 The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students.
 
 
 
 Results
 
 The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance.
 
 
 
 Conclusions
 
 Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinically-relevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs.

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose.

Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines. This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians.

Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education. We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion. We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was -0.65 (p<; 0.005) for private colleges, and -0.34 (p<; 0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is -0.75 (p<; 0.005), and between rank and retention rates is -0.71 (p<; 0.005).

Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications.

The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration.

Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?

Findings
The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.

Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term ìdata scienceî in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as ìe-science,î ìe-research,î ìdata service,î ìdata curationî or ìresearch data management.î

Originality/value

The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a study exploring the emerging field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective.

Findings
A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related.

Research limitations/implications
Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term ìdata scienceî in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as ìe-scienceî, ìe-researchî, ìdata serviceî, ìdata curationî, ìresearch data managementî or ìscientific data managementî or were not present in the Web of Science database.

Originality/value
The paper provides the first exploration by content analysis of the field of data science from the perspective of the LIS.",Scopus,5,3,FALSE,literature review not related to education just on data science,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains.

Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs.

High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning.

Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future.

The model of the ""quantified self""--in which data about one's own activities are collected and made into objects of study--provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students' abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students' statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students' own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of ""remembering"" prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided.

Increasingly more universities are offering individual courses and majors in the field of Data Science. This study evaluates data science education as a means to become proficient in scientific literacy. The results demonstrate how the educational goals of a Data Science course meet the scientific literacy criteria in regards to the process of science. Based on the commonality between data science and scientific literacy courses, the paper concludes that a data science course can be used as an alternative way for students in any major to gain scientific literacy skills.",ERIC,3,2,FALSE,duplicate paper,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since the 1990s, Indian software firms have developed expertise in carrying out outsourced back-office tasks and mid-level IT services like data entry, managing call centres, and performing software quality testing for foreign companies taking advantage of a technically trained local workforce. The trend of automating manual work practices in the IT industry has generated a different kind of demand for data sciences directed at upskilling and job readiness. India is witnessing a market-oriented groundswell of data science and IT skill tutoring ‚Äòshops‚Äô, resituating science and engineering education. In this chapter we report from ethnographic research conducted in two IT skill training parks to underpin arguments about emerging neo-educational learning structures suited to a data science education for new livelihood opportunities in an IT-accredited India. Our chapter makes a case for looking at ‚Äòdata studies‚Äô from an ethnographic perspective uncovering a ‚Äòprogram‚Äô of upward mobility through IT skilling and employment. What directions might data studies about tutoring data science skills in the Indian context lead to? Excerpts presented here from field research imagine new livelihoods, aspirations, and technology skills that are more often than not a reflection of the power of data science education.",Scopus,4,2,FALSE,practitioners,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper reports on a design study in which diverse middle and high school youth in a free summer workshop at an urban public library were asked to model their family geobiographies, or their personal family migration stories, with socioeconomic LSDS. Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants' experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners' capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society. Grounded examples from two family cases are used to illustrate how participants placed their families and selves into data ontologies and the role of family members in composing storylines.",ERIC,4,2,FALSE,k-12,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
