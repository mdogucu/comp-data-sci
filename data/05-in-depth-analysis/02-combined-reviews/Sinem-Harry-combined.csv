This growth has resulted in straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern about how to most effectively respond to the rapidly growing demand and provide equal opportunities for all students to pursue their degree. The primary goal of this work is to provide an intelligent solution to automatically identify biases related to race and gender in the content of Data Science related courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Knowledge Discovery just to name a few. While machine learning allows to build powerful predicting tools, it hasn‚Äôt been used sufficiently to detect biases rooted in gender and race in educational material. Hence, using effective machine learning techniques we aim to enhance the success rate of undergraduate students in Data Science education and programs while promoting engagement through identifying and mitigating potential gender and racial biases. To this end, we propose a novel bias detection approach which uses a combination of gender identification and sentiment classification for characterization of gender and race in educational contents.

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively",Scopus,NA,conference paper,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,K-12

Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications.

In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL.
