To realize the potential of big data in biomedicine, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, funding several centers of excellence in biomedical data analysis and a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with facilitating online and inperson training of biomedical researchers in data science. A major initiative of the BD2K TCC is to automatically identify, describe, and organize data science training resources available on the Web and provide personalized training paths for users. In this paper, we describe the construction of ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, and its release as linked data. ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data.

Spekschoor,2017,"Data Science is an emerging field of science, which requires a multi-disciplinary approach and is based on the Big Data and data intensive technologies that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Modern data driven research and industry require new types of specialists that are capable to support all stages of the data lifecycle from data production and input to data processing and actionable results delivery, visualisation and reporting, which can be jointly defined as the Data Science professions family. The education and training of Data Scientists currently lacks a commonly accepted, harmonized instructional model that reflects all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. The educational model and approach should also solve different aspects of the future professionals that includes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that must be supported by corresponding education infrastructure and educational labs environment. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple form, also providing sufficient data labs facilities for practical training. This paper discussed both aspects: building customizable Data Science curriculum for different types of learners and proposing a hybrid model for virtual labs that can combine local university facility and use cloud based Big Data and Data analytics facilities and services on demand.

In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems.

To address this emerging challenge generally, we develop and deploy a novel Cloud-based Lab for Data Science (CLaDS) to enable many learners around the world to work on real-world data science problems without having to move or otherwise distribute prohibitively large data sets.
