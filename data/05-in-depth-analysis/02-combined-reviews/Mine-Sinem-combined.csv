Our work presents a first step in this direction, by leveraging the coding metrics from traditional software engineering (Halstead Volume and Cyclomatic Complexity) in combination with those that reflect a data science projectís learning objectives (number of library calls and number of common library calls with the solution code). Through these metrics, we examined the code submissions of 97 students across two semesters of an introductory data science course. Our results indicated that the metrics can identify cases where students had overly complicated codes and would benefit from scaffolding feedback. The number of library calls, in particular, was also a significant predictor of changes in submission score and submission runtime, which highlights the distinctive nature of data science programming. We conclude with suggestions for extending our analyses towards more actionable intervention strategies, for example by tracking the fine-grained submission grading outputs throughout a studentís submission history, to better model and support them in their data science learning process.",Scopus,TRUE,conference paper,NA,AK21: LAK21: 11th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference,NA,"United States of America, United States of America, United States of America, United States of America, United States of America, United States of America",???,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,graduate

We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer.

Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?

Findings
The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.

Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term ìdata scienceî in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as ìe-science,î ìe-research,î ìdata service,î ìdata curationî or ìresearch data management.î

Originality/value
The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS.

The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a study exploring the emerging field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective.

Findings
A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related.

Research limitations/implications
Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term ìdata scienceî in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as ìe-scienceî, ìe-researchî, ìdata serviceî, ìdata curationî, ìresearch data managementî or ìscientific data managementî or were not present in the Web of Science database.

First, it crops the tables and recognizes the templates. Second, it classifies the column names and row names into ìmethodî, ìdatasetî, or ìevaluation metricî, and then unified all the table cells into (method, dataset, metric, score)-quadruples. We propose hybrid features including structural and semantic table features as well as an ensemble learning approach for column/row name classification and table unification.

The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service.
