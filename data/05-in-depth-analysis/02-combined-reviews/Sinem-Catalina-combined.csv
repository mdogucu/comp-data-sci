Data Science is becoming a new recognised field of science that leverages the Data Analytics methods with the power of the Big Data technologies and Cloud Computing that both provide a basis for effective use of the data driven research and economy models. Data Science research and education require a multi-disciplinary approach and data driven/centric paradigm shift. Besides core professional competences and knowledge in Data Science, increasing digitalisation of Science and Industry also requires new type of workplace and professional skills that rise the importance of critical thinking, problem solving and creativity required to work in highly automated and dynamic environment. The education and training of the data related professions must reflect all multi-disciplinary knowledge and competences that are required from the Data Science and handling practitioners in modern, data driven research and the digital economy. In modern conditions with the fast technology change and strong skills demand, the Data Science education and training should be customizable and delivered in multiple forms, also providing sufficient lab facilities for practical training. This paper discusses aspects of building customizable and interoperable Data Science curricula for different types of learners and target application domains.

The organizations also have an important role in calibrating the teaching via discussions and maturity reviews.

Mishra,2019,"The increasing importance of data science has created a pressing need for more trained professionals. Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education. We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion. We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was -0.65 (p<; 0.005) for private colleges, and -0.34 (p<; 0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is -0.75 (p<; 0.005), and between rank and retention rates is -0.71 (p<; 0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value.

Our analysis of the notebooks discovers two kinds of student attitudes: explorers, who work iteratively, and goal accomplishers, who work incrementally. Despite varying attitudes, we find that students often fluctuate between the two learner types depending on their computational goals for a given notebook. Moreover, when students practice the explorer approach, they often engage more actively with many CT skills such as pattern generalization and communication of results.
