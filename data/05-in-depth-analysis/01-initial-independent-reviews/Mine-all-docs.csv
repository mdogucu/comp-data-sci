Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?

Findings
The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.

Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term data science in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as e-science, e-research, data service, data curation or research data management.

The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a study exploring the emerging field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective.

Findings
A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related.

Research limitations/implications
Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term data science in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as e-science, e-research, data service, data curation, research data management or scientific data management or were not present in the Web of Science database.

K. F. Yuen; A. O. M. Wong,2022,"Hackathons have been used not only by enterprises for technological innovation and digital transformation, but also in academia for education innovation and programme promotion. This paper presents a hybrid approach for transforming an enterprise's workplace problem into a technology vendor-sponsored hackathon education. A real-life case study of a hackathon for college participants who are prospective students of a university data science programme is demonstrated. The university-industry collaborative approach of the hackathon provides several benefits for its stakeholders, namely promoting the reputation and recognition of the university's data science programme; offering creative and innovative solutions to the enterprise's workplace problems; encouraging the adoption of the technology vendor's platform, and finally, enhancing the teaching and learning experience for the college students and lecturers. This paper provides a structured framework and recommends practical principles and guidelines for designing effective hackathons that can bring about mind-set change and real-world business transformation.",IEEE,NA,unknown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,K-12

Liu,2019,"As a fast-growing field with widespread impact on economy and its promising hiring potential, Data Science has been enthusiastically sought-out by many disciplines in the academia, including Mathematics, Statistics, Library Science, Management Information Systems, as well as Computer Science, as an attracting area for recruiting students, soliciting grants, and expanding their existing programs. Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world.",IEEE,NA,conference paper,NA,2019 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology (EIT),NA,"United States of America, United States of America",program example,FALSE,no data,computer science,It is important for all undergraduate students to know data science.

Paradoxically, recent trends in the public discourse point towards a post-factual world that seems content to ignore or misrepresent empirical evidence. As statistics educators we are challenged to promote understanding of statistics about society. In order to re-root public debate to be based on facts instead of emotions and to promote evidence-based policy decisions, statistics education needs to embrace two areas widely neglected in secondary and tertiary education: understanding of multivariate phenomena and the thinking with and learning from complex data.",ERIC,NA,article,Statistics Education Research Journal,NA,NA,Germany,call to action,FALSE,no data,statistics,Statistics education needs to embrace thinking and learning from complex data.,NA,"Statistical literacy, Data science education, Multivariate reasoning, Open data",TRUE,NA

Tim Brown, president, and CEO of IDEO, defines design thinking as A human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designers toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success. The application of design thinking has been witnessed to be the road to develop innovative applications, interactive systems, scientific software, healthcare application, and even to utilize Design Thinking to re-think business operation as the case of Airbnb. Recently, there has been a movement to apply design thinking to machine learning and artificial intelligence to ensure creating the waw affect to consumers. ACM Taskforce on Data Science program states that Data Scientists should be able to implement and understand algorithms for data collection and analysis. They should understand the time and space considerations of algorithms. They should follow good design principles developing software, understanding the importance of those principles for testability and maintainability However, this definition hides the user behind the machine who works on data preparation, algorithm selection and model interpretation. Thus, Data Science program to include design thinking to ensure meeting the user demands, generating more usable machine learning tools, and developing new ways of framing computational thinking.
