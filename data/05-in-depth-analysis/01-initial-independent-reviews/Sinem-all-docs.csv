Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?

Findings
The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.

Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term ìdata scienceî in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as ìe-science,î ìe-research,î ìdata service,î ìdata curationî or ìresearch data management.î

Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education. We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion. We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was -0.65 (p<; 0.005) for private colleges, and -0.34 (p<; 0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is -0.75 (p<; 0.005), and between rank and retention rates is -0.71 (p<; 0.005).

Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions.

The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well.",Scopus,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",journal article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,not data science education

In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively",Scopus,NA,conference article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,K-12

At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data scienceís challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches.",Scopus,TRUE,journal article,Science& Education,NA,NA,"Netherlands, Netherlands",program example,TRUE,no data,biomedical,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,NA

As an emerging interdisciplinary study field, data science curriculum is typically a collection of individual data science related courses from different schools and departments, most of which are teaching data science in a siloed fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to map the landscape of existing curricula and explore how academic libraries can collaborate and contribute to undergraduate data science education. In this study, we analyzed teaching content and topics of over 100 data science related courses at Purdue University to map the landscape and explore roles of academic libraries to support data science education curriculum. Our results indicate most existing courses focused on ‚Äòhard-core‚Äô scientific analytic principles, such as computer science, statistics, and domain-specific skills. Courses of data-oriented skills, such as data management, data ethics, and data communications were limited across disciplines. In addition, data science courses were more likely targeting STEM students at upper levels (3rd and 4th year students). Academic libraries can enrich data science education efforts, by supporting credit courses, certificate programs, and other co-curricular activities to provide learning opportunities to all students, particularly 1st and 2nd year students and non-STEM majors.",science direct,FALSE,journal article,The Journal of Academic Librarianship,NA,NA,"United States of America, United States of America, United States of America, United States of America, United States of America",pedagogical approach,TRUE,mixed,interdisciplinary,NA,NA,"Data science, Libraries, Curriculum, Education, Data management, College, Data ethics",TRUE,NA

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers.
