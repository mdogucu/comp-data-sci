In this step, we have joined data from all the databases that we gathered data from. 

The joining efforts included

- renaming variable to have consistency across all publications
- retain necessary variables
- drop variables that certainly would not be used in future steps

Details of the joining can be found in `joining-by-catalina.R` file.
