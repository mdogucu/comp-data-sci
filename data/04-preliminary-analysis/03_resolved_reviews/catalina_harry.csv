data science postgraduate education at university of dar es salaam in tanzania: current demands and opportunities,10.1007/978-3-030-19115-3_29,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19115-3_29,"Mbwilo B., Kimaro H., Justo G.",2019,Conference Paper,"Several studies indicate that there are no enough people in the market with data science skills and even those graduates in ICT from universities do not possess skills required by employers. Thus, researchers have suggested the urgency for universities to review their curricular as the world is heading towards data era. The aim of this research was to analyze the current skill-gaps needs from stakeholders and opportunities to establish data science postgraduate programme that reflects the current technological trends and market demands at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). A questionnaire was administered to 85 identified organizations to solicit information on the needs for data scientists and existing skill gaps. A total of 61 filled questionnaires response were received out of the 85 that were administered to selected organizations indicating a turn out rate of over 70%. Overall the analyzed data articulated a compelling evidence for the local industry growing need for data scientist. The survey that was conducted was followed up by conduct of various workshops and meetings to solicit inputs from different experts and stakeholders on different versions of the developed curriculum. Finally, a new programme in MSc in data Science was approved and established from April 2018 at UDSM. Despite its late approval and without formal advertisement on the public media, the programme attracted a large number of applicants for 2018/19 academic year, compared to other several postgraduate programmes in ICT offered at UDSM.",Scopus,"All Open Access, Green",4,1,FALSE,graduate,FALSE,graduate,TRUE,NA
robust effects of the efficacy of explicit failure-driven scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction: a replication and extension,10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101488,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101488,"Sinha T,Kapur M",2021,Journal Article,"Although Productive Failure has shown to be effective (Kapur, 2016; Loibl, Roll, & Rummel, 2017), it is not clear if failure in problem-solving is necessary. Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.",science direct,NA,1,4,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,FALSE,not relevant

taking data feminism to school: a synthesis and review of pre-collegiate data science education projects,10.1111/bjet.13251,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13251,"Lee, Victor R.;Pimentel, Daniel R.;Bhargava, Rahul;D'Ignazio, Catherine",2022,"Article , Report","As the field of K-12 data science education continues to take form, humanistic approaches to teaching and learning about data are needed. Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education.",ERIC,NA,4,1,FALSE,k-12,FALSE,k-12,FALSE,k-12 (if not specific level within k-12)
"orienting, framing, bridging, magic, and counseling: how data scientists navigate the outer loop of client collaborations in industry and academia",10.1145/3476052,https://doi.org/10.1145/3476052,"Kross S., Guo P.",2021,Article,"Data scientists often collaborate with clients to analyze data to meet a client's needs. What does the end-to-end workflow of a data scientist's collaboration with clients look like throughout the lifetime of a project? To investigate this question, we interviewed ten data scientists (5 female, 4 male, 1 non-binary) in diverse roles across industry and academia. We discovered that they work with clients in a six-stage outer-loop workflow, which involves 1) laying groundwork by building trust before a project begins, 2) orienting to the constraints of the client's environment, 3) collaboratively framing the problem, 4) bridging the gap between data science and domain expertise, 5) the inner loop of technical data analysis work, 6) counseling to help clients emotionally cope with analysis results. This novel outer-loop workflow contributes to CSCW by expanding the notion of what collaboration means in data science beyond the widely-known inner-loop technical workflow stages of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science education, parallels to design work, and unmet needs for tool development.",Scopus,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",4,1,FALSE,practitioners,FALSE,practitioners,TRUE,NA
