a call for a humanistic stance toward kâ€“12 data science education,10.3102/0013189x211048810,https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189x211048810,"Lee V.R., Wilkerson M.H., Lanouette K.",2021,Review,"There is growing interest in how to better prepare K–12 students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.",Scopus,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",1,5,FALSE,k-12,FALSE,k-12 (if not specific level within k-12),FALSE,k-12
hess opinions: incubating deep-learning-powered hydrologic science advances as a community,10.5194/hess-22-5639-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5639-2018,"Shen C., Laloy E., Elshorbagy A., Albert A., Bales J., Chang F.-J., Ganguly S., Hsu K.-L., Kifer D., Fang Z., Fang K., Li D., Li X., Tsai W.-P.",2018,Article,"Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a revolutionary and versatile tool transforming industry applications and generating new and improved capabilities for scientific discovery and model building. The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DL-based methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well.",Scopus,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",5,1,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,FALSE,not on data science education. it is about deep learning in hydrology
data science meets science teaching,NA,https://www.nsta.org/science-teacher/science-teacher-januaryfebruary-2022/data-science-meets-science-teaching,"Sagrans, Jacob;Mokros, Janice;Voyer, Christine;Harvey, Meggie",2022,"Article , Report","The use of large, open-source data sets is ubiquitous in scientific research. Scientists--ranging from meteorologists to chemists to epidemiologists--are researching and investigating critical questions using data that they have not themselves collected. To contribute to the growing effort to bring data science into classrooms, the authors have been implementing the NSF-funded ""Data Clubs"" project to examine using data sets on topics such as ticks and Lyme disease, COVID-19, and sports and leisure injuries. Much of this work takes place with youth in out-of-school settings. In addition to developing modules for youth, the authors worked with a group of 18 high school science and computer science teachers from Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts who participated in a virtual 15-hour workshop series on data science education over the summer of 2020. The goal of the workshop was to introduce teachers to real and complex data sets, models for scaffolding learning, and tools for working with those data sets. In this article the authors share some of the key findings from this effort.",ERIC,NA,5,1,FALSE,high school,FALSE,high school,FALSE,practitioners
