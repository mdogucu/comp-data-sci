"the research data life cycle, legacy data, and dilemmas in research data management",10.1002/asi.24645,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24645,"Bossaller J., Million A.J.",2022,Article,"This paper presents findings from an interview study of research data managers in academic data archives. Our study examined policies and professional autonomy with a focus on dilemmas encountered in everyday work by data managers. We found that dilemmas arose at every stage of the research data lifecycle, and legacy data presents particularly vexing challenges. The iFields' emphasis on knowledge organization and representation provides insight into how data, used by scientists, are used to create knowledge. The iFields' disciplinary emphasis also encompasses the sociotechnical complexity of dilemmas that we found arise in research data management. Therefore, we posit that iSchools are positioned to contribute to data science education by teaching about ethics and infrastructure used to collect, organize, and disseminate data through problem-based learning.",Scopus,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",1,2,FALSE,practitioners,TRUE,NA,FALSE,not on data science education (it is about challenges encountered by data managers in academic data archives)
examining spontaneous perspective taking and fluid self-to-data relationships in informal open-ended data exploration,10.1080/10508406.2019.1651317,https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2019.1651317,"Roberts, Jessica;Lyons, Leilah",2020,"Article , Report","Engaging learners with complex unfamiliar datasets is a known challenge in Data Science education. One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person ""actor"" perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: ""role-play"", ""projection"", and ""orientation"". A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (""extrapolating"" and ""noticing absence"") were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., ""enacting"", ""spatially characterizing"", ""generalizing"") were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals.",ERIC,NA,2,1,FALSE,museum visitors,FALSE,museum visitors,TRUE,NA

CCID is currently capable of categorizing footage of Santa Clara University's classrooms as 1. Forward-Facing Lectures 2. Circular or `U' Shaped Lectures and/or whole class discussions 3. Smaller Group discussions and 4. Empty classrooms with 97% accuracy. Further work on the sub-categorization of these categories is underway. CCID has been developed as a component to an ongoing, larger study into the effects of classroom configuration on student learning outcomes. While CCID specifically deals with the categorical analysis of the classroom configuration itself, the next phases of the study will couple this classroom data with anonymized student data, in order to draw conclusions about the most optimal classroom configurations for enhancing learning. By analyzing correlations between different classroom configurations and corresponding student performance, the study will ultimately be able to supply educators with the information needed to setup more effective learning environments.",IEEE,NA,1,2,FALSE,not on data science education (it is about a software using facial recognition to classify a classroom's configuration),TRUE,NA,FALSE,not on data science education (it is about a software using facial recognition to classify a classroom's configuration)
experimental evidence extraction system in data science with hybrid table features and ensemble learning,10.1145/3366423.3380174,https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380174,"Yu W., Peng W., Shu Y., Zeng Q., Jiang M.",2020,Conference Paper,"Data Science has been one of the most popular fields in higher education and research activities. It takes tons of time to read the experimental section of thousands of papers and figure out the performance of the data science techniques. In this work, we build an experimental evidence extraction system to automate the integration of tables (in the paper PDFs) into a database of experimental results. First, it crops the tables and recognizes the templates. Second, it classifies the column names and row names into ìmethodî, ìdatasetî, or ìevaluation metricî, and then unified all the table cells into (method, dataset, metric, score)-quadruples. We propose hybrid features including structural and semantic table features as well as an ensemble learning approach for column/row name classification and table unification.

facilitating api lookup for novices learning data wrangling using thumbnail graphics,10.3934/fods.2021032,https://doi.org/10.3934/fods.2021032,"Sundin, L; Sakr, N; Leinonen, J; Cutts, Q",NA,Article; Early Access,"With the rising demand for data science skills, the ability to wrangle data programmatically becomes a crucial barrier. In this paper, we discuss the centrality of API (application programming interface) lookup to data wrangling, and how an ontology-structured command menu could facilitate it. We design thumbnail graphics as visual alternatives to explaining data wrangling operations and use a survey to validate their quality. We furthermore predict that thumbnail graphics make the menu more navigable, improving lookup efficiency and performance. Our predictions are tested using SLICE N DICE, an online data wrangling tutorial platform that collects learner activity. It includes both non-programmatic and programmatic data wrangling exercises. Participants from a multi-institutional sample (n=200) were randomly assigned the tutorial either with or without thumbnail graphics. Our results show that thumbnail graphics reduce the need for clarifications, thereby assisting API lookup for novices learning data wrangling. We further present some negative results regarding performance gain and follow up with a discussion on why the differences are subtle and how they can be improved. Last but not least, we complement our statistical results with a qualitative study where we receive positive feedback from our participants on the design and helpfulness of the thumbnail graphics.",web of science,NA,1,2,FALSE,not on data science education (it is about good api for data wrangling),TRUE,NA,FALSE,not on data science education (it is about good api for data wrangling)

The results of the case study demonstrate that using live clients within a team-based, project-focused course provides a useful platform in which to teach an introduction to data science course to graduate students across a range of backgrounds.
