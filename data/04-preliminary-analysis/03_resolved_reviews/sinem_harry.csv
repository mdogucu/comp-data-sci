"utilizing multifaceted rasch measurement through facets to evaluate science education data sets composed of judges, respondents, and rating scale items: an exemplar utilizing the elementary science teaching analysis matrix instrument",10.1002/sce.21210,https://doi.org/10.1002/sce.21210,"Boone, William J.;Townsend, J. Scott;Staver, John R.",2016,"Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 142: Reports - Evaluative","When collecting data, science education researchers frequently have multiple respondents evaluate multiple artifacts using multiple criteria. Herein, the authors introduce Multifaceted Rasch Measurement (MFRM) analysis and explain why MFRM must be used when ""judges'"" data are collected. The authors use data from elementary science methods students enrolled in a senior-level, semester-length course. Acting as judges, students used the 23-item Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix (ESTAM) instrument to evaluate five separate science lessons taught by five different teachers. Our MFRM analysis documents that multiple judges need not act as identical robots. Rather, differences in judges' severity can be computed and corrections made in an analysis to take into consideration differing judge severity. This paper extends the current literature in ""Science Education"" regarding the application of Rasch measurement.",ERIC,NA,3,4,FALSE,not data science,FALSE,not data science,FALSE,not relevant
the use of algorithmic models to develop secondary teachers' understanding of the statistical modeling process,10.1080/26939169.2021.1900759,https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2021.1900759,"Zieffler, A; Justice, N; delMas, R; Huberty, MD",2021,Article,"Statistical modeling continues to gain prominence in the secondary curriculum, and recent recommendations to emphasize data science and computational thinking may soon position algorithmic models into the school curriculum. Many teachers' preparation for and experiences teaching statistical modeling have focused on probabilistic models. Subsequently, much of the research literature related to the teachers' understanding has focused on probabilistic models. This study explores the extent to which secondary statistics teachers appear to understand ideas of statistical modeling, specifically the processes of model building and evaluation, when introduced using classification trees, a type of algorithmic model. Results of this study suggest that while teachers were able to read and build classification tree models, they experienced more difficulty when evaluating models. Further research could continue to explore possible learning trajectories, technology tools, and pedagogical approaches for using classification trees to introduce ideas of statistical modeling.",web of science,NA,3,4,FALSE,high school,FALSE,high school,FALSE,high school
interdisciplinary education - the case of biomedical signal processing,10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125200,https://doi.org/10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125200,K. Mike; S. Nemirovsky-Rotman; O. Hazzan,2020,NA,"Interdisciplinary perspective on real-life problems is an important skill for 21st century engineers and should be a part of their education. Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines. This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians. Furthermore, students tend to acknowledge this gap only in the advanced phases of the project, and so critical phases, such as goal setting and planning, are performed without the required knowledge. In this article, we present (a) data that supports the existence of this knowledge gap and its effect on students; (b) an intervention program that exposes students to both the required domain knowledge and its importance to their work; and (c) initial data that supports the success of this intervention program in bridging these gaps.",IEEE,NA,3,4,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,FALSE,not relevant
