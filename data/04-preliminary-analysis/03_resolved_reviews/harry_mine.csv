Yet research shows that students are underprepared in data literacy. Tanya LaMar and Jo Boaler argue that data science education provides an opportunity to address this problem while providing much needed updates to the current mathematics curriculum. The integration of data science can provide a more equitable mathematics pipeline than the calculus-focused pathway that has excluded most students from a future in mathematics. Through data science, students can learn to answer questions that are relevant to their lives and communities, to be critical consumers of the data that surround them every day, and to wield the power of data analysis.",ERIC,NA,5,4,FALSE,k-12,FALSE,k-12,TRUE,NA

This report, which was published by the American Statistical Association (ASA) and endorsed by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) in 2020, presents a set of recommendations toward data literacy at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. ""GAISE II"" offers an update to the original report, ""Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education: A Pre-K-12 Curriculum Framework (GAISE I),"" published in 2007. One of the important updates ""GAISE II"" contributes is a framework for PK-12 students to experience exploring different data types (McNamara and Hansen 2014). How can students effectively grapple with nontraditional data? How do teachers help students become data problem solvers with nontraditional data? This article discusses how using questioning throughout the statistical problem-solving process helps students navigate nontraditional data sets to become data problem solvers.",ERIC,NA,4,5,FALSE,k-12,FALSE,k-12,NA,no-access
