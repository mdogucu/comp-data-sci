tailored data science education using gamification,10.1109/cloudcom.2016.0108,https://doi.org/10.1109/cloudcom.2016.0108,K. Hee; R. V. Zicari; K. Tolle; A. Manieri,2017,NA,"The interest to become a data scientist or related professions in data science domain is rapidly growing. To meet such a demand, we propose a novel educational service that aims to provide a tailored learning paths for data science. Our target user is one who aims to be an expert in data science. Our approach is to analyze the background of the practitioner and match the learning units. A critical feature is that we use gamification to reinforce the practitioner engagement. We believe that our work provides a practical guideline for those who wants to learn data science.",IEEE,NA,2,5,TRUE,NA,FALSE,practitioners,TRUE,NA
computer science meets social studies: embedding cs in the study of locally grounded civic issues,10.1145/2787622.2787751,https://doi.org/10.1145/2787622.2787751,Van Wart S.,2015,Conference Paper,"Data science is an emerging 21st century literacy that promises to support learning in a wide variety of disciplines, from science, to social science, to the humanities. It also provides an engaging context in which to learn computational thinking skills in existing classroom contexts. For my dissertation research, I will explore whether and how data science can support inquiry-based learning in social studies. I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computational thinking to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science.",Scopus,NA,2,5,TRUE,NA,TRUE,NA,FALSE,high school
