the power of data science ontogeny: thick data studies on the indian it skill tutoring microcosm,10.1007/978-3-030-96180-0_4,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-96180-0_4,"Rangaswamy N., Narasimhan H.",2022,Book Chapter,"New employment demands of a burgeoning Indian software service industry are spawning neo-educational structures, especially in the domain of data sciences through vibrant market mechanisms offering a scalable and industry-focused learning system. Since the 1990s, Indian software firms have developed expertise in carrying out outsourced back-office tasks and mid-level IT services like data entry, managing call centres, and performing software quality testing for foreign companies taking advantage of a technically trained local workforce. The trend of automating manual work practices in the IT industry has generated a different kind of demand for data sciences directed at upskilling and job readiness. India is witnessing a market-oriented groundswell of data science and IT skill tutoring ‘shops’, resituating science and engineering education. In this chapter we report from ethnographic research conducted in two IT skill training parks to underpin arguments about emerging neo-educational learning structures suited to a data science education for new livelihood opportunities in an IT-accredited India. Our chapter makes a case for looking at ‘data studies’ from an ethnographic perspective uncovering a ‘program’ of upward mobility through IT skilling and employment. What directions might data studies about tutoring data science skills in the Indian context lead to? Excerpts presented here from field research imagine new livelihoods, aspirations, and technology skills that are more often than not a reflection of the power of data science education.",Scopus,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",4,2,FALSE,practitioners,FALSE,practitioners,FALSE,not on data science education
hack weeks as a model for data science education and collaboration,10.1073/pnas.1717196115,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1717196115,"Huppenkothen D, Arendt A, Hogg DW, Ram K, VanderPlas JT, Rokem A.",2018,NA,"Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.",pubmed,NA,4,2,TRUE,NA,FALSE,extracurricular,TRUE,NA
learning at the intersection of self and society: the family geobiography as a context for data science education,10.1080/10508406.2019.1693377,https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2019.1693377,"Kahn, Jennifer",2020,"Article , Report","Open large-scale datasets (LSDS) and data visualization technologies are new cultural tools that have potential to inform public dialogue and learning about important socioeconomic and scientific matters, particularly if the data is used to consider both personal and shared experiences. This paper reports on a design study in which diverse middle and high school youth in a free summer workshop at an urban public library were asked to model their family geobiographies, or their personal family migration stories, with socioeconomic LSDS. Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants' experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners' capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society. Grounded examples from two family cases are used to illustrate how participants placed their families and selves into data ontologies and the role of family members in composing storylines.",ERIC,NA,4,2,FALSE,k-12,FALSE,k-12,FALSE,middle school and high school

a blended-learning program for implementing a rigorous machine-learning curriculum in high-schools,10.1145/3491140.3528291,https://doi.org/10.1145/3491140.3528291,"Perach S., Alexandron G.",2022,Conference Paper,"AI, and, more specifically, deep learning, is profoundly impacting our industries and societies [1]. In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively",Scopus,NA,4,2,TRUE,NA,FALSE,mooc,TRUE,NA

Here we describe the development and performance of a computing platform developed to support a series of MOOCs in clinical data science. This platform was designed to restrict and log all access to health datasets while also being scalable, accessible, secure, privacy preserving, and easy to access.

In this paper, we examine the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling—strategies for selecting and managing datasets to produce a model and story in a big data interface—for youth assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools. Through interaction analysis of video data, we identified ten data wrangling practices and developed a conceptual model of the data wrangling process that contains four interrelated recursive stages. These data wrangling practices and the process of data wrangling are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positioned the youth as having agency and authority over big data.",Scopus,NA,2,4,TRUE,NA,FALSE,not on data science education (it is about different data wrangling approaches),FALSE,not relevant
