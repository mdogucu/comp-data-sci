## Article Selection


At this selection we are trying to figure out if we should keep each piece in our analysis or not. Recall that the focus is on the *undergraduate level*. If a piece is on K-12 and undergraduate, let's say, then we should keep it. If it is solely on K-12 then we need to eliminate it. We will make this decision solely by reading the abstract. 

Every reviewer has a separate `csv` file with their name. 

There are two new variables 

`keep`: please enter TRUE or FALSE depending on whether we should keep the piece for further analysis or not.

`why_not_keep`: if you think we should not keep the piece then please enter a reason why it should not be kept. You can be as articulate as possible.

When in doubt set `keep` equal to TRUE. We can eliminate the piece at the next level of analysis.

Here are some codes used for `why_not_keep` variable. Feel free to extend the list. Some are very broad and some are very specific. Make sure to even jot down the specific ones so that we can be consistent with each other in coding.

General reasons:

- middle school
- high school
- middle school and high school
- K-12 (if not specific level within K-12)
- graduate
- practitioners
- retracted 
- researchers
- methodology (added after second round of reviews)
- instructors
- poster


Specific reasons:

- poster session summary with multiple posters
- about journals
- museum visitors
- introduction to a journal's special issue
- note from journal's editor
- letter to journal's editor
- panel
- interview
- not on data science education (it is about ...)
- MOOCs
- presentation summary

---

If you cannot access a file please let `keep` equal to NA.

Conclusions: Of the 197 papers, we kept 130 and chose to not keep 67 articles. For each reason, the number of articles excluded are shown below:

- K-12 (13)
- middle school (7)
- high school (8)
- graduate (10)
- practitioners (4)
- panel (6)
- not on data science education (3)
- complete conference proceedings (3) 
- duplicate of another paper present in our review (5)

Specific reasons:

- elementary school (1)
- workshop for data science researchers (1)
- poster session with multiple posters (1)
- citizen science (1)
- museum visitors (1)
- not in english (1)
- retracted (1) 
- ad-hoc organizers (1)




## Ideas for Future

If you think of anything else we should track in addition to the variables of interest noted in `meeting-notes.md` please note. We will track these variables in our next round of analysis.
