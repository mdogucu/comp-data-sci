robust effects of the efficacy of explicit failure-driven scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction: a replication and extension,10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101488,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101488,"Sinha T,Kapur M",2021,Journal Article,"Although Productive Failure has shown to be effective (Kapur, 2016; Loibl, Roll, & Rummel, 2017), it is not clear if failure in problem-solving is necessary. Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.",science direct,NA,1,4,TRUE,NA

We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion.

Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: ""role-play"", ""projection"", and ""orientation"". A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (""extrapolating"" and ""noticing absence"") were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., ""enacting"", ""spatially characterizing"", ""generalizing"") were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships.

Despite the growing interest in health data science education, it is not embedded in undergraduate medical curricula and little is known about best teaching practices. This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science.

Methods
The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students.

Results
The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance.

Conclusions
Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinically-relevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives.",pubmed,NA,1,5,TRUE,NA

Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective.

Findings
A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related.

Research limitations/implications
Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term ìdata scienceî in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as ìe-scienceî, ìe-researchî, ìdata serviceî, ìdata curationî, ìresearch data managementî or ìscientific data managementî or were not present in the Web of Science database.

The success of the workshop in equipping participants to do reproducible computational science was in part due to the successful acculturation process, whereby participants comprehended, altered, and enacted new norms amongst themselves. At the same time, we observed potential challenges for data science instruction resulting from the rhetorical framing of the technologies as inescapably new. This language, which mirrors that of a successful grant proposal, tends to obscure the deeply embedded and contingent history of the command-line technologies required to preform computational science, many of which are decades old.

Data science is a relatively new field which has gained considerable attention in recent years. This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective.

Design/methodology/approach
Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective?

Findings
The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences.

Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term ìdata scienceî in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as ìe-science,î ìe-research,î ìdata service,î ìdata curationî or ìresearch data management.î

Originality/value
The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.",Scopus,NA,1,4,TRUE,NA

In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole.

Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction.

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module.

In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform.",IEEE,NA,4,1,TRUE,NA
data science meets science teaching,NA,https://www.nsta.org/science-teacher/science-teacher-januaryfebruary-2022/data-science-meets-science-teaching,"Sagrans, Jacob;Mokros, Janice;Voyer, Christine;Harvey, Meggie",2022,"Article , Report","The use of large, open-source data sets is ubiquitous in scientific research. Scientists--ranging from meteorologists to chemists to epidemiologists--are researching and investigating critical questions using data that they have not themselves collected. To contribute to the growing effort to bring data science into classrooms, the authors have been implementing the NSF-funded ""Data Clubs"" project to examine using data sets on topics such as ticks and Lyme disease, COVID-19, and sports and leisure injuries. Much of this work takes place with youth in out-of-school settings. In addition to developing modules for youth, the authors worked with a group of 18 high school science and computer science teachers from Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts who participated in a virtual 15-hour workshop series on data science education over the summer of 2020. The goal of the workshop was to introduce teachers to real and complex data sets, models for scaffolding learning, and tools for working with those data sets. In this article the authors share some of the key findings from this effort.",ERIC,NA,5,1,FALSE,practitioners
big data science education: a case study of a project-focused introductory course,NA,https://www.learntechlib.org/p/171521/,"Saltz, Jeffrey;Heckman, Robert",2015,"Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research","This paper reports on a case study of a project-focused introduction to big data science course. The pedagogy of the course leveraged boundary theory, where students were positioned to be at the boundary between a client's desire to understand their data and the academic class. The results of the case study demonstrate that using live clients within a team-based, project-focused course provides a useful platform in which to teach an introduction to data science course to graduate students across a range of backgrounds. While more work needs to be done to compare different possible pedagogies for teaching an introduction to data science course, the results of this study indicate that one successful approach is a project-focused class that puts students at the boundary between the academic context of the course and solving a real-world problem for their client.",ERIC,NA,1,2,FALSE,graduate
facilitating api lookup for novices learning data wrangling using thumbnail graphics,10.3934/fods.2021032,https://doi.org/10.3934/fods.2021032,"Sundin, L; Sakr, N; Leinonen, J; Cutts, Q",NA,Article; Early Access,"With the rising demand for data science skills, the ability to wrangle data programmatically becomes a crucial barrier. In this paper, we discuss the centrality of API (application programming interface) lookup to data wrangling, and how an ontology-structured command menu could facilitate it. We design thumbnail graphics as visual alternatives to explaining data wrangling operations and use a survey to validate their quality. We furthermore predict that thumbnail graphics make the menu more navigable, improving lookup efficiency and performance. Our predictions are tested using SLICE N DICE, an online data wrangling tutorial platform that collects learner activity. It includes both non-programmatic and programmatic data wrangling exercises. Participants from a multi-institutional sample (n=200) were randomly assigned the tutorial either with or without thumbnail graphics. Our results show that thumbnail graphics reduce the need for clarifications, thereby assisting API lookup for novices learning data wrangling. We further present some negative results regarding performance gain and follow up with a discussion on why the differences are subtle and how they can be improved. Last but not least, we complement our statistical results with a qualitative study where we receive positive feedback from our participants on the design and helpfulness of the thumbnail graphics.",web of science,NA,1,2,TRUE,NA
