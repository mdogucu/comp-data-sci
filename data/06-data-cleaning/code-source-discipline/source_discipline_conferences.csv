These technologies have reimagined traditional educational paradigms, leading to more interactive, accessible, and efficient learning environments.

Information Technology, in the context of education, is revolutionizing the way we store, process, and communicate information, making it more accessible and meaningful. Advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing are some of the technological developments that have profoundly impacted the way educational institutions manage and use data, leading to more personalized and effective learning experiences. Education Technology, often termed EdTech, encompasses a broad array of tools, such as digital classrooms, interactive online courses, and AI-driven tutoring systems, all aimed at enhancing the learning process. Over time, these technologies have opened up new learning avenues, improved student engagement, and made education more inclusive. From machine learning algorithms that adapt to students' learning styles to VR applications that provide immersive learning experiences, the opportunities are limitless.

The convergence of Information and Education Technology has a profound impact on the way we perceive and approach education. As a forum dedicated to discussing these transformative changes, 2025 the 13th International Conference on Information and Education Technology (ICIET) will take place in Fukuyama, Japan, from April 18-20, 2025, which is co-sponsored by Fukuyama University, co-hosted by Shonan Institute of Technology.
