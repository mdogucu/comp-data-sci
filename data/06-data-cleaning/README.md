## Data Cleaning

This final stage cleaned up inconsistencies in the data (e.g. ensuring we were consistent with how we referred to countries in the author affiliation column) to make quantitative analysis possible. The file [data-cleaning-script.qmd](data-cleaning-script.qmd) contains a step-by-step explanation of the data cleaning choices made, and [summary-tables.qmd](summary-tables.qmd) contains summaries of the data after this cleaning. The cleaning script writes the final [../all_reviews.csv](all_reviews.csv) file which is the final conclusion of our analysis.
