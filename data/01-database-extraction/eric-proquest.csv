Taking Data Feminism to School: A Synthesis and Review of Pre-Collegiate Data Science Education Projects,"As the field of K-12 data science education continues to take form, humanistic approaches to teaching and learning about data are needed. Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education.",2722592653, EJ1344719,Scholarly Journals,"Lee, Victor R.;Pimentel, Daniel R.;Bhargava, Rahul;D'Ignazio, Catherine",,10.1111/bjet.13251," Article , Report",, Sep 2022,,0007-1013,5, English, English, 1096-1113,Sep 2022,British Journal of Educational Technology," Scholarly Journals , Scholarly Journals",2022, https://www.wiley.com/en-us," ERIC, © Wiley",53,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/taking-data-feminism-school-synthesis-review-pre/docview/2722592653/se-2?accountid=14511, Elementary Secondary Education, 1096," 2602ER1 2584ER5 , 3989ER1 3949ER5 , 9247ER1 98ER1 9167ER5 96ER5 , 4987ER1 4937ER5 , 8169ER1 7498ER1 8097ER5 7430ER5 , 3298ER1 8947ER1 3269ER5 8868ER5 , 8958ER1 2799ER1 8879ER5 2780ER5 , 3311ER1 10805ER1 3282ER5 10713ER5 , 2521ER1 2501ER1 2875ER1 2503ER5 2483ER5 2854ER5 , 9899ER1 1586ER1 5700ER1 9815ER5 1573ER5 5646ER5 , 5082ER1 5032ER5 , 10227ER1 6497ER1 3192ER1 , 3412ER1 3192ER1 3382ER5 3164ER5", Elementary Secondary Education,https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Taking+Data+Feminism+to+School%3A+A+Synthesis+and+Review+of+Pre-Collegiate+Data+Science+Education+Projects&amp;title=British+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=00071013&amp;date=2022-09-01&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=1096&amp;au=Lee%2C+Victor+R.%3BPimentel%2C+Daniel+R.%3BBhargava%2C+Rahul%3BD%27Ignazio%2C+Catherine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=British+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1344719&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fbjet.13251,ERIC
Students' Actual Purposes When Engaging with a Computerized Simulation in the Context of Citizen Science,"In today's information age, developing data science competencies has become vital to fostering responsible citizenry. However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat ""in-construction"", as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes.",2722592601, EJ1344696,Scholarly Journals,"Dvir, Michal;Ben-Zvi, Dani",,10.1111/bjet.13238," Article , Report",, Sep 2022,,0007-1013,5, English, English, 1202-1220,Sep 2022,British Journal of Educational Technology," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2022, https://www.wiley.com/en-us," ERIC, © Wiley",53,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/students-actual-purposes-when-engaging-with/docview/2722592601/se-2?accountid=14511," Junior High Schools , Middle Schools , Secondary Education", 1202," 6726ER1 10411ER1 8114ER1 4605ER1 6665ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 , 2602ER1 2584ER5 , 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 5436ER1 6663ER1 5385ER5 6603ER5 , 9769ER1 6663ER1 9687ER5 6603ER5 , 9431ER1 8876ER1 9350ER5 8800ER5 , 10358ER1 6915ER1 10268ER5 6852ER5 , 5954ER1 5899ER5 , 2099ER1 2098ER1 10811ER1 2085ER5 2084ER5 10719ER5"," Junior High Schools , Middle Schools , Secondary Education",https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Students%27+Actual+Purposes+When+Engaging+with+a+Computerized+Simulation+in+the+Context+of+Citizen+Science&amp;title=British+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;issn=00071013&amp;date=2022-09-01&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=1202&amp;au=Dvir%2C+Michal%3BBen-Zvi%2C+Dani&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=British+Journal+of+Educational+Technology&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1344696&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fbjet.13238,ERIC
Data Science Meets Science Teaching,"The use of large, open-source data sets is ubiquitous in scientific research. Scientists--ranging from meteorologists to chemists to epidemiologists--are researching and investigating critical questions using data that they have not themselves collected. To contribute to the growing effort to bring data science into classrooms, the authors have been implementing the NSF-funded ""Data Clubs"" project to examine using data sets on topics such as ticks and Lyme disease, COVID-19, and sports and leisure injuries. Much of this work takes place with youth in out-of-school settings. In addition to developing modules for youth, the authors worked with a group of 18 high school science and computer science teachers from Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts who participated in a virtual 15-hour workshop series on data science education over the summer of 2020. The goal of the workshop was to introduce teachers to real and complex data sets, models for scaffolding learning, and tools for working with those data sets. In this article the authors share some of the key findings from this effort.",2661119813, EJ1329912,Scholarly Journals,"Sagrans, Jacob;Mokros, Janice;Voyer, Christine;Harvey, Meggie"," 1742255 , 1917653",," Article , Report",, Jan 2022,,0036-8555,3, English, English, 64-69,Jan 2022,Science Teacher," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2022, https://www.nsta.org/," ERIC, © National Science Teaching Association",89,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/data-science-meets-teaching/docview/2661119813/se-2?accountid=14511," High Schools , Secondary Education", 64," 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 9452ER1 5309ER1 9371ER5 5259ER5 , 4805ER1 9535ER1 10726ER1 8373ER1 3464ER1 5777ER1 4975ER1 9030ER1 8114ER1 4605ER1 4757ER5 , 9461ER1 10726ER1 8373ER1 3464ER1 5777ER1 4975ER1 9030ER1 8114ER1 4605ER1 9380ER5 10634ER5 8297ER5 3431ER5 5722ER5 4925ER5 8950ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 , 2079ER1 5222ER1 8365ER1 3192ER1 2065ER5 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5 , 3839ER1 8363ER1 5778ER1 2820ER1 10133ER1 3802ER5 8288ER5 5723ER5 2799ER5 10048ER5 , 10725ER1 11736ER1 10633ER5 11639ER5 , 2082ER1 9769ER1 6663ER1 2068ER5 9687ER5 6603ER5 , 9234ER1 10756ER1 3270ER1 6663ER1 9154ER5 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5 , 7447ER1 10805ER1 7379ER5 10713ER5 , 1697ER1 7513ER1 4605ER1 1683ER5 7444ER5 4558ER5 , 2958ER1 2911ER1 2936ER5 2890ER5 , 2395ER1 1873ER1 2958ER1 2911ER1 , 7600ER1 , 5250ER1 2911ER1 5200ER5 2890ER5 , Maine , New Hampshire , Massachusetts"," High Schools , Secondary Education",https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Data+Science+Meets+Science+Teaching&amp;title=Science+Teacher&amp;issn=00368555&amp;date=2022-01-01&amp;volume=89&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=64&amp;au=Sagrans%2C+Jacob%3BMokros%2C+Janice%3BVoyer%2C+Christine%3BHarvey%2C+Meggie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Science+Teacher&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1329912&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ERIC
Towards Culturally Relevant Personalization at Scale: Experiments with Data Science Learners,"In this article we describe our experiences building a large-scale data science program aimed at supporting diversity in online data science learning. This program was built to support a set of introductory skills-based, higher education courses. We are motivated by work done in project-based learning contexts and culturally responsive pedagogies and are particularly keen to understand how we can scale such kinds of approaches to large and diverse global classrooms. Specifically, we consider the country from which a learner is accessing the course as the key context for our work and discuss two interrelated investigations we have undertaken to understand how this feature interacts with learners' motivation and learning. Our findings provide insights on how learners respond to location-specific problem-based personalizations in data science education and provides an initial exploration as to how this form of personalization differs depending on the geo-political context of the learners.",2595752242, EJ1309744,Scholarly Journals,"Brooks, Christopher;Quintana, Rebecca M.;Choi, Heeryung;Quintana, Chris;NeCamp, Timothy;Gardner, Joshua",,10.1007/s40593-021-00262-2," Article , Report",, Sep 2021,,1560-4292,3, English, English, 516-537,Sep 2021,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2021, https://link.springer.com/," ERIC, © Springer",31,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/towards-culturally-relevant-personalization-at/docview/2595752242/se-2?accountid=14511," Higher Education , Postsecondary Education", 516," 5552ER1 2379ER1 2544ER1 5501ER5 2362ER5 2526ER5 , 2530ER1 2523ER1 3192ER1 8882ER1 2512ER5 8806ER5 2505ER5 3164ER5 , 4809ER1 8147ER1 3192ER1 4761ER5 8075ER5 3164ER5 , 10372ER1 9259ER1 128ER1 10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5 , 126ER1 5956ER1 124ER5 5901ER5 , 10756ER1 3270ER1 6663ER1 10664ER5 3241ER5 6603ER5 , 5975ER1 6915ER1 5918ER5 6852ER5 , 10227ER1 6497ER1 3192ER1 , 7420ER1 2099ER1 2098ER1 10811ER1 2379ER1 2544ER1 7356ER5 2085ER5 2084ER5 10719ER5 2362ER5 2526ER5 , 8402ER1 8326ER5 , 4166ER1 4394ER1 4124ER5 4350ER5 , 10329ER1 2994ER1 2875ER1 10319ER1 10239ER5 2483ER5 2854ER5 10229ER5 , 8332ER1 5956ER1 8257ER5 5901ER5 , 5483ER1 4437ER1 3192ER1 4435ER1 4853ER1 6663ER1 5432ER5 4392ER5 4390ER5 4803ER5 6603ER5 3164ER5"," Higher Education , Postsecondary Education",https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Towards+Culturally+Relevant+Personalization+at+Scale%3A+Experiments+with+Data+Science+Learners&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Artificial+Intelligence+in+Education&amp;issn=15604292&amp;date=2021-09-01&amp;volume=31&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=516&amp;au=Brooks%2C+Christopher%3BQuintana%2C+Rebecca+M.%3BChoi%2C+Heeryung%3BQuintana%2C+Chris%3BNeCamp%2C+Timothy%3BGardner%2C+Joshua&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Artificial+Intelligence+in+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1309744&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs40593-021-00262-2,ERIC
The Importance and Emergence of K-12 Data Science,"The COVID-19 global pandemic has required everyone to make sense of data about community spread, levels of risk, and vaccine efficacy. Yet research shows that students are underprepared in data literacy. Tanya LaMar and Jo Boaler argue that data science education provides an opportunity to address this problem while providing much needed updates to the current mathematics curriculum. The integration of data science can provide a more equitable mathematics pipeline than the calculus-focused pathway that has excluded most students from a future in mathematics. Through data science, students can learn to answer questions that are relevant to their lives and communities, to be critical consumers of the data that surround them every day, and to wield the power of data analysis.",2580876464, EJ1308536,Scholarly Journals,"LaMar, Tanya;Boaler, Jo",,10.1177/00317217211043627," Article , Report",, Sep 2021,,0031-7217,1, English, English, 49-53,Sep 2021,Phi Delta Kappan," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2021, http://sagepub.com," ERIC, © SAGE Publications",103,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/importance-emergence-k-12-data-science/docview/2580876464/se-2?accountid=14511, Elementary Secondary Education, 49," 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 6499ER1 5309ER1 6440ER5 5259ER5 , 6496ER1 2544ER1 6437ER5 2526ER5 , 8882ER1 8806ER5 , 3412ER1 3192ER1 3382ER5 3164ER5 , 9913ER1 8339ER1 9829ER5 8264ER5", Elementary Secondary Education,https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=The+Importance+and+Emergence+of+K-12+Data+Science&amp;title=Phi+Delta+Kappan&amp;issn=00317217&amp;date=2021-09-01&amp;volume=103&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=49&amp;au=LaMar%2C+Tanya%3BBoaler%2C+Jo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Phi+Delta+Kappan&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1308536&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1177%2F00317217211043627,ERIC

"Remembering What Produced the Data: Individual and Social Reconstruction in the Context of a ""Quantified Self"" Elementary Data and Statistics Unit","Given growing interest in K-12 data and data science education, new approaches are needed to help students develop robust understandings of and familiarity with data. The model of the ""quantified self""--in which data about one's own activities are collected and made into objects of study--provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students' abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students' statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students' own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of ""remembering"" prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided.

Data Wrangling Practices and Collaborative Interactions with Aggregated Data,"Data visualization technologies are powerful tools for telling evidence-based narratives about oneself and the world. This paper contributes to the literature on data science education by examining the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling--strategies for selecting and managing large, aggregated datasets to produce a model and story. We examined the learning opportunities related to data wrangling practices by investigating youth's talk-in-interaction while assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools and large socioeconomic datasets. We first identified ten sociotechnical practices that characterize youth's interaction with tools and collaboration in data wrangling. We then suggest four categories of activities to describe patterns of learning related to the practices, including addressing missing data, understanding data aggregation, exploring social or historical events that constitute the formation of data patterns, and varying data visual encoding for storytelling. These practices and activities are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positions the youth as having agency and authority over the data and contributes to the design of CSCL environments that tackle the challenges of data wrangling.",2488226114, EJ1267933,Scholarly Journals,"Jiang, Shiyan;Kahn, Jennifer", 1341882,10.1007/s11412-020-09327-1," Article , Report",, Sep 2020,,1556-1607,3, English, English, 257-281,Sep 2020,International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2020, https://link.springer.com/," ERIC, © Springer",15,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/data-wrangling-practices-collaborative/docview/2488226114/se-2?accountid=14511,, 257," 2607ER1 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 5217ER1 5226ER1 9672ER1 2589ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 5167ER5 5176ER5 9591ER5 , 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 11460ER1 1733ER1 11364ER5 1719ER5 , 10262ER1 5826ER1 10174ER5 5771ER5 , 8970ER1 8339ER1 8891ER5 8264ER5 , 6754ER1 6832ER1 6693ER5 6769ER5 , 6838ER1 9769ER1 6663ER1 6775ER5 9687ER5 6603ER5",,https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Data+Wrangling+Practices+and+Collaborative+Interactions+with+Aggregated+Data&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Computer-Supported+Collaborative+Learning&amp;issn=15561607&amp;date=2020-09-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=257&amp;au=Jiang%2C+Shiyan%3BKahn%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Computer-Supported+Collaborative+Learning&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1267933&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11412-020-09327-1,ERIC
Examining Spontaneous Perspective Taking and Fluid Self-to-Data Relationships in Informal Open-Ended Data Exploration,"Engaging learners with complex unfamiliar datasets is a known challenge in Data Science education. One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person ""actor"" perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: ""role-play"", ""projection"", and ""orientation"". A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (""extrapolating"" and ""noticing absence"") were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., ""enacting"", ""spatially characterizing"", ""generalizing"") were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals.",2396842842, EJ1242233,Scholarly Journals,"Roberts, Jessica;Lyons, Leilah"," 1248052 , HD51357",10.1080/10508406.2019.1651317," Article , Report",, 2020,,1050-8406,1, English, English, 32-56,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2020, http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals," ERIC, © Routledge",29,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/examining-spontaneous-perspective-taking-fluid/docview/2396842842/se-2?accountid=14511,, 32," 7879ER1 7809ER5 , 2602ER1 2584ER5 , 5221ER1 9466ER1 6042ER1 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5 , 6991ER1 3812ER1 6928ER5 3775ER5 , 3725ER1 7209ER1 3689ER5 7145ER5 , 11460ER1 1733ER1 11364ER5 1719ER5 , 6394ER1 11444ER1 6335ER5 11348ER5 , 9134ER1 9769ER1 6663ER1 9054ER5 9687ER5 6603ER5 , 9566ER1 9485ER5 , 7517ER1 7448ER5 , 2252ER1 5956ER1 2236ER5 5901ER5 , 2014ER1 5400ER1 8516ER1 5118ER1 2000ER5 5350ER5 8440ER5 5068ER5",,https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Examining+Spontaneous+Perspective+Taking+and+Fluid+Self-to-Data+Relationships+in+Informal+Open-Ended+Data+Exploration&amp;title=Journal+of+the+Learning+Sciences&amp;issn=10508406&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=32&amp;au=Roberts%2C+Jessica%3BLyons%2C+Leilah&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+the+Learning+Sciences&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1242233&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F10508406.2019.1651317,ERIC
Situating Data Science: Exploring How Relationships to Data Shape Learning,"The emerging field of Data Science has had a large impact on science and society. This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science--its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded--suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners' engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education.",2396828480, EJ1242215,Scholarly Journals,"Wilkerson, Michelle Hoda;Polman, Joseph L.", IIS1541676,10.1080/10508406.2019.1705664," Article , Report",, 2020,,1050-8406,1, English, English, 1-10,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2020, http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals," ERIC, © Routledge",29,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/situating-data-science-exploring-how/docview/2396828480/se-2?accountid=14511,, 1," 2602ER1 2584ER5 , 5222ER1 8365ER1 3192ER1 5172ER5 8290ER5 3164ER5 , 5956ER1 5901ER5 , 2607ER1 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 5217ER1 5226ER1 9672ER1 2589ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 5167ER5 5176ER5 9591ER5 , 3298ER1 8947ER1 3269ER5 8868ER5 , 2621ER1 5242ER1",,https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Situating+Data+Science%3A+Exploring+How+Relationships+to+Data+Shape+Learning&amp;title=Journal+of+the+Learning+Sciences&amp;issn=10508406&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Wilkerson%2C+Michelle+Hoda%3BPolman%2C+Joseph+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+the+Learning+Sciences&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1242215&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F10508406.2019.1705664,ERIC
Learning at the Intersection of Self and Society: the Family Geobiography as a Context for Data Science Education,"Open large-scale datasets (LSDS) and data visualization technologies are new cultural tools that have potential to inform public dialogue and learning about important socioeconomic and scientific matters, particularly if the data is used to consider both personal and shared experiences. This paper reports on a design study in which diverse middle and high school youth in a free summer workshop at an urban public library were asked to model their family geobiographies, or their personal family migration stories, with socioeconomic LSDS. Youth represented family decision-making and social conditions that might have motivated family movements with online, dynamic data modeling and mapping tools (Gapminder.org; SocialExplorer.com). The qualitative video analysis examined participants' experiences and learning in storytelling and modeling the family geobiography, focusing on multimodal talk-in-interaction to understand how the study design engaged learners' capacities, histories, and imagined futures in relation to the LSDS and supported learning about oneself and society.

Envisioning the Data Science Discipline: The Undergraduate Perspective--Interim Report. Consensus Study Report,"The need to manage, analyze, and extract knowledge from data is pervasive across industry, government, and academia. Scientists, engineers, and executives routinely encounter enormous volumes of data, and new techniques and tools are emerging to create knowledge out of these data, some of them capable of working with real-time streams of data. The nation's ability to make use of these data depends on the availability of an educated workforce with necessary expertise. With these new capabilities have come novel ethical challenges regarding the effectiveness and appropriateness of broad applications of data analyses. The field of data science has emerged to address the proliferation of data and the need to manage and understand it. Data science is a hybrid of multiple disciplines and skill sets, draws on diverse fields (including computer science, statistics, and mathematics), encompasses topics in ethics and privacy, and depends on specifics of the domains to which it is applied. Fueled by the explosion of data, jobs that involve data science have proliferated and an array of data science programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels have been established. Nevertheless, data science is still in its infancy, which suggests the importance of envisioning what the field might look like in the future and what key steps can be taken now to move data science education in that direction. This study will set forth a vision for the emerging discipline of data science at the undergraduate level. This interim report lays out some of the information and comments that the committee has gathered and heard during the first half of its study, offers perspectives on the current state of data science education, and poses some questions that may shape the way data science education evolves in the future. The study will conclude in early 2018 with a final report that lays out a vision for future data science education.

Statistical Literacy for Active Citizenship: A Call for Data Science Education,"Data are abundant, quantitative information about the state of society and the wider world is around us more than ever. Paradoxically, recent trends in the public discourse point towards a post-factual world that seems content to ignore or misrepresent empirical evidence. As statistics educators we are challenged to promote understanding of statistics about society. In order to re-root public debate to be based on facts instead of emotions and to promote evidence-based policy decisions, statistics education needs to embrace two areas widely neglected in secondary and tertiary education: understanding of multivariate phenomena and the thinking with and learning from complex data.",1969007846, EJ1152522,Scholarly Journals,"Engel, Joachim",,," Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 141: Reports - Descriptive", 1570-1824, May 2017,,,1, English, English, 44-49,May 2017,Statistics Education Research Journal," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2017, http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/," ERIC, © International Association for Statistics Education and the International Statistical Institute",16,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/statistical-literacy-active-citizenship-call-data/docview/1969007846/se-2?accountid=14511, Secondary Education, 44," 10226ER1 6490ER1 6042ER1 10140ER5 6431ER5 5983ER5 , 2602ER1 2584ER5 , 9469ER1 9388ER5 , 7286ER1 7222ER5 , 6497ER1 3192ER1 6438ER5 3164ER5 , 1556ER1 7711ER1 921ER1 1543ER5 7641ER5 912ER5 , 10988ER1 1722ER1 2ER1 9809ER1 10896ER5 1708ER5 1ER5 9726ER5 , 9524ER1 3412ER1 3192ER1 9443ER5 3382ER5 3164ER5 , 8147ER1 3192ER1 8075ER5 3164ER5", Secondary Education,https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Statistical+Literacy+for+Active+Citizenship%3A+A+Call+for+Data+Science+Education&amp;title=Statistics+Education+Research+Journal&amp;issn=1570-1824&amp;date=2017-05-01&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=44&amp;au=Engel%2C+Joachim&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Statistics+Education+Research+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1152522&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ERIC
"Utilizing Multifaceted Rasch Measurement through Facets to Evaluate Science Education Data Sets Composed of Judges, Respondents, and Rating Scale Items: An Exemplar Utilizing the Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix Instrument","When collecting data, science education researchers frequently have multiple respondents evaluate multiple artifacts using multiple criteria. Herein, the authors introduce Multifaceted Rasch Measurement (MFRM) analysis and explain why MFRM must be used when ""judges'"" data are collected. The authors use data from elementary science methods students enrolled in a senior-level, semester-length course. Acting as judges, students used the 23-item Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix (ESTAM) instrument to evaluate five separate science lessons taught by five different teachers. Our MFRM analysis documents that multiple judges need not act as identical robots. Rather, differences in judges' severity can be computed and corrections made in an analysis to take into consideration differing judge severity. This paper extends the current literature in ""Science Education"" regarding the application of Rasch measurement.",1826519288, EJ1090912,Scholarly Journals,"Boone, William J.;Townsend, J.

The Effectiveness of Data Science as a Means to Achieve Proficiency in Scientific Literacy,"Data Science courses are becoming more prevalent in recent years. Increasingly more universities are offering individual courses and majors in the field of Data Science. This study evaluates data science education as a means to become proficient in scientific literacy. The results demonstrate how the educational goals of a Data Science course meet the scientific literacy criteria in regards to the process of science. Based on the commonality between data science and scientific literacy courses, the paper concludes that a data science course can be used as an alternative way for students in any major to gain scientific literacy skills.",1913350981, EJ1137388,Scholarly Journals,"Ceccucci, Wendy;Tamarkin, Dawn;Jones, Kiku",,," Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research", 1545-679X, Jul 2015,,,4, English, English, 64-70,Jul 2015,Information Systems Education Journal," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2015, http://isedj.org," ERIC, © Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals",13,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effectiveness-data-science-as-means-achieve/docview/1913350981/se-2?accountid=14511," Higher Education , Postsecondary Education", 64," 5221ER1 9466ER1 6042ER1 5171ER5 9385ER5 5983ER5 , 4809ER1 8147ER1 3192ER1 4761ER5 8075ER5 3164ER5 , 9473ER1 6964ER1 9392ER5 6120ER5 , 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 2607ER1 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 5217ER1 5226ER1 9672ER1 2589ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 5167ER5 5176ER5 9591ER5 , 9457ER1 9809ER1 2ER1 9376ER5 9726ER5 1ER5 , 9475ER1 8963ER1 6663ER1 9394ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5"," Higher Education , Postsecondary Education",https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=The+Effectiveness+of+Data+Science+as+a+Means+to+Achieve+Proficiency+in+Scientific+Literacy&amp;title=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;issn=1545-679X&amp;date=2015-07-01&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=64&amp;au=Ceccucci%2C+Wendy%3BTamarkin%2C+Dawn%3BJones%2C+Kiku&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Information+Systems+Education+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1137388&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ERIC
Big Data Science Education: A Case Study of a Project-Focused Introductory Course,"This paper reports on a case study of a project-focused introduction to big data science course. The pedagogy of the course leveraged boundary theory, where students were positioned to be at the boundary between a client's desire to understand their data and the academic class. The results of the case study demonstrate that using live clients within a team-based, project-focused course provides a useful platform in which to teach an introduction to data science course to graduate students across a range of backgrounds. While more work needs to be done to compare different possible pedagogies for teaching an introduction to data science course, the results of this study indicate that one successful approach is a project-focused class that puts students at the boundary between the academic context of the course and solving a real-world problem for their client.",1895969388, EJ1131005,Scholarly Journals,"Saltz, Jeffrey;Heckman, Robert",,," Article , Report , 080: Journal Articles , 143: Reports - Research", 1792-8788, 2015,,,2, English, English, 85-94,2015,Themes in Science and Technology Education," Scholarly Journals , Reports",2015, http://earthlab.uoi.gr/theste," ERIC, © Themes in Science and Technology Education",8,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/big-data-science-education-case-study-project/docview/1895969388/se-2?accountid=14511," Higher Education , Postsecondary Education", 85," 9442ER1 3192ER1 9361ER5 3164ER5 , 9440ER1 2544ER1 9359ER5 2526ER5 , 4670ER1 4623ER5 , 9430ER1 128ER1 9349ER5 126ER5 , 1342ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 8947ER1 1331ER5 8868ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 5552ER1 2379ER1 2544ER1 5501ER5 2362ER5 2526ER5 , 2602ER1 2584ER5 , 1822ER1 1788ER1 2544ER1 9440ER1 1808ER5 1774ER5 2526ER5 9359ER5 , 4514ER1 1829ER1 10411ER1 8114ER1 4605ER1 4467ER5 1815ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 , 126ER1 5956ER1 124ER5 5901ER5 , 10372ER1 9259ER1 128ER1 10282ER5 9179ER5 126ER5 , 4515ER1 4809ER1 8147ER1 3192ER1 4468ER5 4761ER5 8075ER5 3164ER5 , 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 2607ER1 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 5217ER1 5226ER1 9672ER1 2589ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 5167ER5 5176ER5 9591ER5 , 6819ER1 8963ER1 6663ER1 6756ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 , 10210ER1 2604ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 10393ER1 10514ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 10303ER5 10423ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 , 5542ER1 3679ER1 6663ER1 5491ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5"," Higher Education , Postsecondary Education",https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/UCL/UCL_VU2?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeric&amp;atitle=Big+Data+Science+Education%3A+A+Case+Study+of+a+Project-Focused+Introductory+Course&amp;title=Themes+in+Science+and+Technology+Education&amp;issn=1792-8788&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=85&amp;au=Saltz%2C+Jeffrey%3BHeckman%2C+Robert&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Themes+in+Science+and+Technology+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/EJ1131005&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ERIC
