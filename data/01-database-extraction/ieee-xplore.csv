"The Michigan Data Science Team: A Data Science Education Program with Significant Social Impact","A. Farahi; J. C. Stroud",University of Michigan; University of Michigan,"2018 IEEE Data Science Workshop (DSW)","19 Aug 2018","2018","","","120","124","One role of universities is to provide students with the practical knowledge necessary to address broad societal needs. The growing field of data science has the potential to address many of these needs, primarily due to recent efforts to collect large amounts of data related to social, environmental, and political issues. A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service. In this work, we outline this outreach program, the Michigan Data Science Team, and provide empirical evidence of positive educational and social impact.","","978-1-5386-4410-2","10.1109/DSW.2018.8439915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8439915","Data Science Education;Service-Learning;Social Impact;Collaborative Learning","Data science;Tutorials;Collaboration;Mentoring;Organizations;Encoding","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data analysis;educational courses;educational institutions","practical knowledge;social issues;political issues;real-world issues;outreach program;positive social impact;positive educational impact;community service;University students;environmental issues;Universities;data science education program;Michigan data science team","","3","","18","IEEE","19 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A second wave of data science education is emerging, one with increased emphasis on practical issues in ethics, legal compliance, scientific reproducibility, data quality, and algorithmic bias. The data engineering community has a second chance to influence these programs beyond just providing a set of tools.

Students of Data Science area usually face the difficulty of understanding the complex of real-time data and sophisticated statistical indicators and models. Another difficulty is students are easy to lost interests and patience during the process of learning programming and analysis process, such as R-language. Stock market, as a huge data source and an important data disciplinary, is comparatively easy to attract student attentions. Thus, we developed an intuitive trading platform for education purpose. The platform contains three components: an exploring window, a control windows and a report window. The exploring window shows current and historical stock price trends and related indicators. Several representative stocks from different sectors can be picked and specific time frames can be assigned. The control window allows students to develop their own trading strategies. A trading strategy can be created by either intuitive way, or through single or combinations of indicators, or be built generically though plug-in R-programing module. The report window demonstrates the expected return of a stock in a specific time frame through a specific strategy. A more comprehensive report with detailed transaction information is also provided for back-testing purpose. Students are involved into the development of the software and get experience for R-programming. Preliminary version of the product has been tested and surveyed in a data science classroom. About ten junior Data Science students have practiced and provided feedback. The positive survey results show the feasibility of the approach. In the future, artificial intelligent component will be integrated into the platform.","","978-1-7281-7008-4","10.1109/CSEI50228.2020.9142534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142534","Data Science;Trading Platform;R-Programming","Data science;Industries;Education;Programming profession;Microsoft Windows","artificial intelligence;computer science education;pricing;stock markets;user interfaces","R-language;junior data science students;data science classroom;trading strategy;specific time frame;representative stocks;historical stock price trends;report window;control window;education purpose;intuitive trading platform;student attentions;huge data source;stock market;programming learning;sophisticated statistical indicators;real-time data;Data Science area;in-house-developed stock trading platform;simulated trading platform;data science education;stock data","","2","","5","","17 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, universities and higher education institutions are starting to offer undergraduate programs and courses for Data Science education. In this sense, EDISON Data Science Framework (EDSF) is presented as a relevant framework to further the education of Data Science Professionals. Thus, this article addresses the integration of EDSF with ADDIE Model, an instructional design model, capable of enabling the construction of an Instructional System (IS). Based on the Learning Outcomes (LO) of the EDSF Model Curriculum Data Science (MC-DS), the article proposes an integrated approach of these LOs along with the phases of ADDIE Model supporting the construction of a Data Science Instructional System (DSIS). This integrated approach assists the understanding of the development of a DSIS and its learning objects, with its technological needs, such as: hardware environment, programming environments (IDEs, scripts, etc.), database models (SQL and NoSQL), massive data storage and processing tools, visualization tools, among others.","","978-1-6654-3957-2","10.1109/BDEE52938.2021.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9626308","data science;EDISON framework;instructional design;professional education","Analytical models;Education;Data visualization;Data science;Tools;Data models;Hardware","computer aided instruction;computer science education;decision making;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;learning (artificial intelligence);SQL","Data Science education;EDISON Data Science Framework;relevant framework;Data Science Professionals;ADDIE Model;instructional design model;EDSF Model Curriculum Data Science;Data Science Instructional System;database models;massive data storage;processing tools;EDISON Framework;integrates data engineering;computing intelligence;recent professional field;Computer Science;Artificial Intelligence;specific Business Models;organizations that pursue data intelligence;Data Science professionals;higher education institutions","","","","17","IEEE","2 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it. Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., “Women in Engineering”, in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective. Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants' perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective.

Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education. We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion. We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was -0.65 (p<; 0.005) for private colleges, and -0.34 (p<; 0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is -0.75 (p<; 0.005), and between rank and retention rates is -0.71 (p<; 0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value.

Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways.

This growth has resulted in straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern about how to most effectively respond to the rapidly growing demand and provide equal opportunities for all students to pursue their degree. The primary goal of this work is to provide an intelligent solution to automatically identify biases related to race and gender in the content of Data Science related courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, Data Analytics, and Knowledge Discovery just to name a few. While machine learning allows to build powerful predicting tools, it hasn’t been used sufficiently to detect biases rooted in gender and race in educational material. Hence, using effective machine learning techniques we aim to enhance the success rate of undergraduate students in Data Science education and programs while promoting engagement through identifying and mitigating potential gender and racial biases. To this end, we propose a novel bias detection approach which uses a combination of gender identification and sentiment classification for characterization of gender and race in educational contents. Our proposed framework can help educators and course developers to mitigate race and gender biases in their course materials and create an equitable learning experience for students of minority and under-represented groups.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766530","Gender and Racial Equity;Machine Learning;Data Science;Education","Image processing;Sociology;Machine learning;Data science;Knowledge discovery;Natural language processing;Equal opportunities","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data analysis;data mining;education;educational courses;gender issues;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","machine learning;ML-assisted framework;equity-driven education;significant surge;course enrollments;program resources;causing concern;rapidly growing demand;equal opportunities;intelligent solution;Data Science related courses;Data Mining;Data Analytics;Knowledge Discovery;powerful predicting tools;educational material;effective machine;undergraduate students;identifying mitigating potential gender;racial biases;bias detection approach;gender identification;sentiment classification;educational contents;course developers;course materials;equitable learning experience","","","","14","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines. This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians. Furthermore, students tend to acknowledge this gap only in the advanced phases of the project, and so critical phases, such as goal setting and planning, are performed without the required knowledge. In this article, we present (a) data that supports the existence of this knowledge gap and its effect on students; (b) an intervention program that exposes students to both the required domain knowledge and its importance to their work; and (c) initial data that supports the success of this intervention program in bridging these gaps.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125200","Interdisciplinary education;data science education;biomedical signal processing;project-based learning","Electrical engineering;Knowledge engineering;Industries;Hospitals;Project management;Signal processing;Data science","educational courses;electrical engineering education;medical signal processing","21st century engineers;pedagogical tool;interdisciplinary education;interdisciplinary learning;cross-disciplinary teams;project team;fourth-year electrical engineering students;knowledge gap;domain knowledge;biomedical signal processing;project-based learning","","1","","19","IEEE","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
