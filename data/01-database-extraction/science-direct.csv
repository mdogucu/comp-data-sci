This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science. Methods The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students. Results The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance. Conclusions Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinically-relevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives.","Data science, Health, Medicine, Education, Training, Health informatics"

Research on this scale, however, requires a high level of computational and data-science expertise, limiting the researchers who are capable of undertaking social media data-driven research to those with significant computational expertise or those who have access to such experts as part of their research team. The Social Media Macroscope (SMM) is a science gateway with the goal of removing that limitation and making social media data, analytics, and visualization tools accessible to researchers and students of all levels of expertise. The SMM provides a single point of access to a suite of intuitive web interfaces for performing social media data collection, analysis, and visualization via for open-source and commercial tools. Within the SMM social scientists are able to process and store large datasets and collaborate with other researchers by sharing ideas, data, and methods. This document functions as a brief primer on the initial build of the SMM and we end this paper discussing future directions for the SMM.","Social media analytics, Science gateway, Cloud computing, Research computing infrastructure"

As an emerging interdisciplinary study field, data science curriculum is typically a collection of individual data science related courses from different schools and departments, most of which are teaching data science in a siloed fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to map the landscape of existing curricula and explore how academic libraries can collaborate and contribute to undergraduate data science education. In this study, we analyzed teaching content and topics of over 100 data science related courses at Purdue University to map the landscape and explore roles of academic libraries to support data science education curriculum. Our results indicate most existing courses focused on ‘hard-core’ scientific analytic principles, such as computer science, statistics, and domain-specific skills. Courses of data-oriented skills, such as data management, data ethics, and data communications were limited across disciplines. In addition, data science courses were more likely targeting STEM students at upper levels (3rd and 4th year students). Academic libraries can enrich data science education efforts, by supporting credit courses, certificate programs, and other co-curricular activities to provide learning opportunities to all students, particularly 1st and 2nd year students and non-STEM majors.","Data science, Libraries, Curriculum, Education, Data management, College, Data ethics"

In data sciences, there are two related but distinct strategies: hypothesis testing and binary classification. In practice, how to choose between these two strategies can be unclear and rather confusing. Here, we summarize key distinctions between these two strategies in three aspects and list five practical guidelines for data analysts to choose the appropriate strategy for specific analysis needs. We demonstrate the use of those guidelines in a cancer driver gene prediction example.",""

Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.","Data science education, Higher education, Failure, Scaffolding, Problem-based learning"

Such experience can be provided in courses/internships aimed at preparing qualified personnel to work on solution-oriented projects. These lessons are designed to deepen understanding in particular elements of ocean data science education: oceanography as a science in evolution, mutual understanding, the enrichment of data, and the process of moving from data to information. Such lessons combine the history of ocean science with ocean data methodologies and technologies, data quality elements, “fitness for use”/“fitness for purpose” and analyses. The approach consists of a significant mentoring program aimed at strengthening “thinking skills”—critical and creative thinking—and therefore the ability to solve complex problems.","Data management, Interdisciplinarity, Knowledge, Mutual understanding, Ocean data science, Solution-oriented education"
