As an emerging interdisciplinary study field, data science curriculum is typically a collection of individual data science related courses from different schools and departments, most of which are teaching data science in a siloed fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to map the landscape of existing curricula and explore how academic libraries can collaborate and contribute to undergraduate data science education. In this study, we analyzed teaching content and topics of over 100 data science related courses at Purdue University to map the landscape and explore roles of academic libraries to support data science education curriculum. Our results indicate most existing courses focused on ?hard-core? scientific analytic principles, such as computer science, statistics, and domain-specific skills. Courses of data-oriented skills, such as data management, data ethics, and data communications were limited across disciplines. In addition, data science courses were more likely targeting STEM students at upper levels (3rd and 4th year students). Academic libraries can enrich data science education efforts, by supporting credit courses, certificate programs, and other co-curricular activities to provide learning opportunities to all students, particularly 1st and 2nd year students and non-STEM majors.","[Shao, Gang; Zakharov, Wei] Purdue Univ Lib, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Shao, Gang; Zakharov, Wei] Sch Informat Studies, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Quintana, Jenny P.; Purzer, Senay; Kim, Eunhye] Purdue Univ, Sch Engn Educ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",,"Shao, G (corresponding author), Purdue Univ Lib, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;Shao, G (corresponding author), Sch Informat Studies, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",gshao@purdue.edu,"Zakharov, Wei/F-5762-2016","Zakharov, Wei/0000-0002-7805-6675; Shao, Gang/0000-0003-3198-966X",,,,,79,1,1,7,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0099-1333,1879-1999,,J ACAD LIBR,J.

Data science, including mathematics, statistics, big data, machine learning, and deep learning, can be considered as the intersection of statistics, mathematics and computer science. Although the debate continues about the core area of data science, the subject is a huge hit. Universities have a high demand for data science. They are trying to live up to this demand by opening postgraduate and doctoral programs. Since the subject is a new field, there are significant differences between the programs given by universities in data science. Besides, since the subject is close to statistics, most of the time, data science programs are opened in the statistics departments, and this also causes differences between the programs. In this article, we will summarize the data science education developments in the world and in Turkey specifically and how data science education should be at the graduate level.","[Gursakal, Necmi] Fenerbahce Univ, Atasehir, Turkey; [Ozkan, Ecem; Oktay, Deniz] Uludag Univ, Bursa, Turkey; [Yilmaz, Firat Melih] Uludag Univ, Dept Econ, Bursa, Turkey",,"Gursakal, N (corresponding author), Fenerbahce Univ, Atasehir, Turkey.",,"Ozkan, Ecem/AAA-4674-2021; Yılmaz, Fırat/GRO-5689-2022; Yılmaz, Fırat Melih/AAU-9056-2020; Oktay, Deniz/ABF-7016-2020","Yılmaz, Fırat Melih/0000-0001-5816-4321; Oktay, Deniz/0000-0001-8872-3606",,,,,29,0,0,6,37,IGI GLOBAL,HERSHEY,"701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA",2160-9500,2160-9543,,INT J ENERGY OPTIM E,Int.

A challenge is that there exists a disconnect between these real-world issues and the course materials taught to university students. This gap is due in part to a lack of engagement between universities and their local communities, leaving students with few opportunities to work with datasets relevant to real-world problems. To address this disconnect, the authors have implemented a novel data science education and outreach program in which students acquire new knowledge and skills while creating positive social impact through community service.

This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science-its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded-suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners' engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline. Together, the contributions offer a vision of how the learning sciences can contribute to a more expansive, agentive and socially aware Data Science Education.","[Wilkerson, Michelle Hoda] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, 2121 Berkeley Way West,Off 4413, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Polman, Joseph L.] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Wilkerson, MH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, 2121 Berkeley Way West,Off 4413, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",mwilkers@berkeley.edu,"Wilkerson, Michelle/GLS-6903-2022; Polman, Joseph L/D-2134-2013","Polman, Joseph L/0000-0001-9513-2783; Wilkerson, Michelle/0000-0001-8250-068X",National Science Foundation Cyberlearning capacity building grant [IIS-1541676],National Science Foundation Cyberlearning capacity building grant,"Many ideas discussed in this introduction emerged from collective discussion at the 2016 Youth, Learning, and Data Science Summit.

At the same time, philosophers of science face the challenge of making their expertise accessible for scientists in such a way that it can improve everyday research practice. Here, we investigate the possibility of approaching these challenges together. In current and proposed approaches to biomedical data science education, we identify a dominant focus on only one aspect of conducting scientific research: understanding and using data, research methods, and statistical methods. We argue that this approach cannot solve biomedical data science's challenge and we propose to shift the focus to four other aspects of conducting research: making and justifying decisions in research design and implementation, explaining their epistemic and non-epistemic effects, balancing varying responsibilities, and reporting scientific research. Attending to these aspects requires learning on different dimensions than solely learning to apply techniques (first dimension). It also requires learning to make choices (second dimension) and to understand the rationale behind choices (third dimension). This could be fostered by integrating philosophical training in biomedical data science education. Furthermore, philosophical training fosters a fourth dimension of learning, namely, understanding the nature of science. In this article, we explain how we identified the five aspects of conducting research and the four dimensions of learning, and why attending to the fourth dimension is essential. We discuss educational approaches to attend to all aspects and dimensions, and present initial design principles to implement these approaches.","[Pieterman-Bos, Annelies; van Mil, Marc H.

These new trends impact the society and future jobs, and thus student careers. At the heart of this digital transformation is data science, the discipline that makes sense of big data. With many rapidly emerging digital challenges ahead of us, this article discusses perspectives on iSchools' opportunities and suggestions in data science education. We argue that iSchools should empower their students with information computing disciplines, which we define as the ability to solve problems and create values, information, and knowledge using tools in application domains. As specific approaches to enforcing information computing disciplines in data science education, we suggest the three foci of user-based, tool-based, and application-based. These three foci will serve to differentiate the data science education of iSchools from that of computer science or business schools. We present a layered Data Science Education Framework (DSEF) with building blocks that include the three pillars of data science (people, technology, and data), computational thinking, data-driven paradigms, and data science lifecycles. Data science courses built on the top of this framework should thus be executed with user-based, tool-based, and application-based approaches. This framework will help our students think about data science problems from the big picture perspective and foster appropriate problem-solving skills in conjunction with broad perspectives of data science lifecycles. We hope the DSEF discussed in this article will help fellow iSchools in their design of new data science curricula.","[Song, Il-Yeol; Zhu, Yongjun] Drexel Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Song, IY (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",song@drexel.edu,"Rosenstein, Maarika/AAE-5585-2019; Zhu, Yongjun/K-2486-2015","Zhu, Yongjun/0000-0003-4787-5122",,,,,16,17,17,4,38,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",2096-157X,2543-683X,,J DATA INFO SCI,J.

A general education IT course provides a unique opportunity to integrate data science education. Modules covering databases, spreadsheets, and presentation software, already present in many survey IT courses, teach concepts and skills needed for data science. As a result, a survey IT course can provide comprehensive introductory data science education by adding a data science module focused on modeling and evaluation, two key steps in the data science process. The module should use data science software for application, avoiding the complexities of programming and advanced math, while enabling an emphasis on conceptual understanding.

Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data feminism is an emergent framework for changing data practices and discourse in service of equity and justice. Data science education is rapidly growing as a topic of interest in the educational technology research and design communities. Many educational technology and design projects have been launched and shared in publications that preceded the widespread distribution of the data feminism framework. What this paper adds Data feminism is partially re-articulated in terms familiar to educational technology research communities. Prior and recent projects are organized with respect to how they illustrate potential connections to core data feminism principles. This paper identifies specific strategies that recent projects have used that have potential for realizing data feminism principles. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technologists can use the re-articulated principles of data feminism for education to inform their future design work. Tractable steps to achieve data justice that are attainable within existing educational systems can be pursued. Communities can and should bring together multiple ways of knowing to support new educational practices and futures with data.","[Lee, Victor R.; Pimentel, Daniel R.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bhargava, Rahul] Northeastern Univ, Journalism & Art Design, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [D'Ignazio, Catherine] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Lee, VR (corresponding author), Stanford Grad Sch Educ, 485 Lasuen Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",vrlee@stanford.edu,,"Pimentel, Daniel/0000-0001-9700-8727; Lee, Victor/0000-0001-6434-7589",,,,,81,1,1,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

Further, the increased availability of large-scale electronically accessible data sets is an untapped area of study. This interpretive study examined middle school students' understanding of statistical concepts involved in making a plan to collect data to answer a statistical question within a social issue context using data available on the internet. Student artifacts, researcher notes, and audio and video recordings from nine groups of 20 seventh-grade students in two gifted education pull-out classes at a suburban middle school were used to answer the study research questions. Data were analyzed using a priori codes from previously developed frameworks and by using an inductive approach to find themes. Three themes that emerged from data related to confirmation bias. Some middle school students held preconceptions about the social issues they chose to study that biased their statistical questions. This in turn influenced the sources of data students used to answer their questions. Confirmation bias is a serious issue that is exacerbated due to endless sources of data electronically available. We argue that this type of bias should be addressed early in students' educational experiences. Based on the findings from this study, we offer recommendations for future research and implications for statistics and data science education.","[Hedges, Sarai] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Math Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Given, Kim] Indian Hill Middle Sch, Indian Hill, OH USA",,"Hedges, S (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Math Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",Sarai.Hedges@uc.edu; kim.given@ihsd.us,,,,,,,43,0,0,1,2,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604, UNITED STATES",,2639-8001,,FOUND DATA SCI,Found.

Although ethical frameworks have the ability to reflect cultural priorities, a singular view of ethics, as we explore, often fails to speak to the multiple and diverse priorities held both within and across institutional spaces. To that end, this paper explores multiple perspectives, epistemologies, and worldviews that can collectively push researchers towards considerations of a data science education that is equity -minded both in concept and practice. Through a set of dialogues which examine our positionalities, journeys, ethics, local cultures, and accountabilities, this pa-per explores the contextual realities rooted in the authors' educational settings. These conversations focus on the humanity of our students, the communities from which we come from and serve, as well as the unintentional harms and possibilities associated with the development of data science programs across institutional types. We take a set of five core questions to examine how we made, and continue to make, sense of our diverse cultural perspectives on data science education and equity with/in relation to others' realities.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to reveal the reality of data science education in the Middle East and to determine the opportunities and challenges for teaching data science in the region. Thirteen countries in the Middle East were offering 48 data science programmes at the time of the study. The results reveal that these data science programmes significantly use the words 'data' and 'analytics' in their names. With regard to the academic affiliations of the data science programmes, the study found that they are offered in a variety of schools, especially computer science, information technology and business. Moreover, the study found that computer science is the dominant trend in the programmes. Data science programmes have a significant overlap with other programmes, especially statistics and computer science, because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field. Data science schools in the Middle East differ in terms of their programme titles, programme descriptions, course catalogues, curriculum structures and course objectives.

Although extracurricular efforts already exist for many computationally intensive disciplines, their support of data science education has significantly helped in coping with the speed of innovation in data science practice and formal curricula. While the proliferation of ad hoc efforts is an indication of their popularity, less has been documented about the needs that they are designed to meet, the limitations that they face, and practical suggestions for holding successful efforts. To holistically understand the role of different ad hoc formats for data science, we surveyed organizers of ad hoc data science education efforts to understand how organizers perceived the events to have gone-including areas of strength and areas requiring growth. We also gathered recommendations from these past events for future organizers. Our results suggest that the perceived benefits of ad hoc efforts go beyond developing technical skills and may provide continued benefit in conjunction with formal curricula, which warrants further investigation. As increasing numbers of researchers from computational fields with a history of complex data become involved with ad hoc efforts to share their skills, the lessons learned that we extract from the surveys will provide concrete suggestions for the practitioner-leaders interested in creating, improving, and sustaining future efforts. Author summary Large datasets are becoming integral to society broadly and to biological sciences in particular. As a result, demand for sophisticated data skills and experience has skyrocketed and left some individuals scrambling to cross-train and acquire more computational skills. While universities are racing to develop formal curricula to meet this demand, diverse informal efforts have emerged to fill the immediate demand for skills and experience. These ad hoc efforts have been playing a vital role in data science education, especially for domain scientists. While some studies have shown specific ad hoc formats to have considerable impact, few studies have focused on these efforts holistically. Here, we survey effort organizers from leading data science institutes and collect lessons learned. We find that efforts are commonly reported to successfully provide opportunities in difficult areas where curricula could improve, such as providing approachable introductions to new skills, increasing diversity of backgrounds, and fostering heterogeneous communities. However, efforts also report challenges fulfilling diverse needs and offer suggestions. In total, the lessons that we collect from these efforts are useful to improve future ad hoc efforts and to inform formal programs, which may be looking for inspiration to design innovative educational formats.","[DeMasi, Orianna] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Comp Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Paxton, Alexandra] Univ Connecticut, Dept Psychol Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [Paxton, Alexandra] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Ecol Study Percept & Act, Storrs, CT USA; [Koy, Kevin] IDEO, San Francisco, CA USA",,"DeMasi, O (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Comp Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",odemasi@ucdavis.edu,,"Paxton, Alexandra/0000-0002-8603-015X",,,,,39,0,0,0,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1553-734X,1553-7358,,PLOS COMPUT BIOL,PLoS Comput.

Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results.

Unlike these disciplines, however, data science education remains heavily focused on theory and methods, and practical coursework typically revolves around cleaned or simplified data sets that have little analog in professional applications. We believe that the environment in which new data scientists are trained should more accurately reflect that in which they will eventually practice, and we propose here a data science master's degree program that takes inspiration from the residency model used in medicine. Students in the suggested program would spend their time working on a practical problem with an industry, government, or nonprofit partner, supplemented with coursework in data science methods and theory. We also discuss how this program can also be implemented in shorter formats to augment existing professional master's programs in different disciplines. This approach to learning by doing is designed to fill gaps in our current approach to data science education and ensure that students develop the skills they need to practice data science in a professional context and under the many constraints imposed by that context.","[Rodolfa, Kit T.; De Unanue, Adolfo; Gee, Matt; Ghani, Rayid] Univ Chicago, Ctr Data Sci & Publ Policy, Comp Sci Dept, Chicago, IL USA; [Rodolfa, Kit T.; De Unanue, Adolfo; Gee, Matt; Ghani, Rayid] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL USA; [Rodolfa, Kit T.; Ghani, Rayid] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Machine Learning Dept, 4902 Forbes Ave,Gates Hillman 8023, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Ghani, Rayid] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll Informat Syst & Publ Policy, 4902 Forbes Ave,Gates Hillman 8023, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [De Unanue, Adolfo] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Dept Math, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Ghani, R (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Machine Learning Dept, 4902 Forbes Ave,Gates Hillman 8023, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;Ghani, R (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll Informat Syst & Publ Policy, 4902 Forbes Ave,Gates Hillman 8023, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",rayid@cmu.edu,,"Rodolfa, Kit/0000-0002-0829-1282",,,,,35,1,1,0,5,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2167-6461,2167-647X,,BIG DATA-US,Big Data,1-Dec,2019,7,4,,,,,249,261,,10.1089/big.2019.0100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/big.2019.0100,,,13,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,JX2UQ,31860342,Green Submitted,,,10/20/2022,WOS:000503596400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper contributes to the literature on data science education by examining the sociotechnical practices of data wrangling-strategies for selecting and managing large, aggregated datasets to produce a model and story. We examined the learning opportunities related to data wrangling practices by investigating youth's talk-in-interaction while assembling models and stories about family migration using interactive data visualization tools and large socioeconomic datasets. We first identified ten sociotechnical practices that characterize youth's interaction with tools and collaboration in data wrangling. We then suggest four categories of activities to describe patterns of learning related to the practices, including addressing missing data, understanding data aggregation, exploring social or historical events that constitute the formation of data patterns, and varying data visual encoding for storytelling. These practices and activities are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positions the youth as having agency and authority over the data and contributes to the design of CSCL environments that tackle the challenges of data wrangling.","[Jiang, Shiyan] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Teacher Educ & Learning Sci, Poe Hall 208,2310 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Kahn, Jennifer] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",,"Jiang, SY (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Teacher Educ & Learning Sci, Poe Hall 208,2310 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",sjiang24@ncsu.edu,,"Jiang, Shiyan/0000-0003-4781-846X",National Science Foundation [1341882],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1341882.

This emergence also extends to undergraduate education, whereby a growing number of institutions now offer degree programs in data science. However, there is considerable variation in what the field actually entails and, by extension, differences in how undergraduate programs prepare students for data-intensive careers. We used two seminal frameworks for data science education to evaluate undergraduate data science programs at a subset of 4-year institutions in the United States; developing and applying a rubric, we assessed how well each program met the guidelines of each of the frameworks. Most programs scored high in statistics and computer science and low in domain-specific education, ethics, and areas of communication. Moreover, the academic unit administering the degree program significantly influenced the course-load distribution of computer science and statistics/mathematics courses. We conclude that current data science undergraduate programs provide solid grounding in computational and statistical approaches, yet may not deliver sufficient context in terms of domain knowledge and ethical considerations necessary for appropriate data science applications. Additional refinement of the expectations for undergraduate data science education is warranted.","[Oliver, Jeffrey C.; McNeil, Torbet] Univ Arizona, Univ Lib, Off Digital Innovat & Stewardship, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [McNeil, Torbet] Univ Arizona, Dept Educ Policy Studies & Practice, Tucson, AZ USA",,"Oliver, JC (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Univ Lib, Off Digital Innovat & Stewardship, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",jcoliver@email.arizona.edu,,"Oliver, Jeffrey/0000-0003-2160-1086",,,,,27,1,1,4,19,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",,2376-5992,,PEERJ COMPUT SCI,PeerJ Comput.

In this article, we reflect on JSDSE's relevance to K-12 education and how it might increase its influence in this area. We characterize JSDSE's K-12 impact partially in terms of its ability to foster statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT). We also introduce a new construct, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2), to more fully capture the K-12 contributions JSDSE can make. Our analysis draws upon the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher (the first author) and a statistics education researcher (the second author). The first author of the article surveyed recent JSDSE issues to identify and reflect upon articles with implications for his teaching practice. The second author framed the first author's article reflections in terms of their connections to SKT and SKT2. Drawing upon our collaborative analysis, we propose strategies to help JSDSE more fully realize its potential to contribute to SKT and SKT2. We explain how acting on the proposed strategies may help JSDSE readers, authors, and editors bridge the persistent historical gap between formal scholarship and practice in K-12 education.","[Dalton, Michael] State Coll Area High Sch, State Coll, PA USA; [Groth, Randall E.] Salisbury Univ, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",,"Groth, RE (corresponding author), Salisbury Univ, 1101 Camden Ave, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",regroth@salisbury.edu,,"Groth, Randall/0000-0002-1266-1397",,,,,42,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2693-9169,,J STAT DATA SCI EDUC,J.

The author argues that at the secondary level, an introductory data science course should strive to teach data-scientific thinking, which has statistical thinking at its core, blended with some computational thinking, and with a dash of mathematics.","[Gould, Robert] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, 8495 Math Sci Build,Mailcode 91554, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Gould, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, 8495 Math Sci Build,Mailcode 91554, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rgould@stat.ucla.edu,,", Robert/0000-0001-5392-5945",,,,,52,4,4,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0141-982X,1467-9639,,TEACH STAT,Teach.

Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it. Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., Women in Engineering, in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective. Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants' perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective. Keywords-data science, data science education, gender balance, interdisciplinary of data science.","[Mike, Koby; Hazzan, Orit] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Educ Sci & Technol, Haifa, Israel; [Hartal, Gilly] Bar Ilan Univ, Gender Studies Program, Ramat Gan, Israel",,"Mike, K (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Educ Sci & Technol, Haifa, Israel.",kobymike@gmail.com; gilly.hartal@biu.ac.il; oritha@technion.ac.il,,"Hartal, Gilly/0000-0002-5084-5680",Bernard M.

Design/methodology/approach Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related. Research limitations/implications Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term data science in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as e-science, e-research, data service, data curation, research data management or scientific data management or were not present in the Web of Science database. Originality/value The paper provides the first exploration by content analysis of the field of data science from the perspective of the LIS.","[Virkus, Sirje] Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Garoufallou, Emmanouel] Int Hellen Univ, Sch Social Sci, Dept Lib Sci Arch & Informat Syst, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Garoufallou, Emmanouel] Deltos Grp, Thessaloniki, Greece",,"Virkus, S (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",sirje.virkus@tlu.ee; mgarou@ihu.gr,,"Virkus, Sirje/0000-0001-8427-2414",,,,,86,8,9,22,148,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2514-9288,2514-9318,,DATA TECHNOL APPL,Data Technol.

However, enabling instructors to flexibly deliver all kinds of data science assignments using real world data sets to large numbers of learners (both on-campus and off-campus) at low cost is a significant open challenge. To address this emerging challenge generally, we develop and deploy a novel Cloud-based Lab for Data Science (CLaDS) to enable many learners around the world to work on real-world data science problems without having to move or otherwise distribute prohibitively large data sets. Leveraging version control and continuous integration, CLaDS provides a general infrastructure to enable any instructor to conveniently deliver any hands-on data science assignment that uses large real world data sets to as many learners as our cloud-computing infrastructure allows at very low cost. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CLaDS and discuss our experience with using CLaDS to deploy seven major text data assignments for students in both an on-campus course and an online course to work on for learning about text data retrieval and mining techniques; this shows that CLaDS is a very promising novel general infrastructure for efficiently delivering a wide range of hands-on data science assignments to a large number of learners at very low cost.","[Geigle, Chase; Lourentzou, Ismini; Sundaram, Hari; Zhai, ChengXiang] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"Geigle, C (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",geigle1@illinois.edu; lourent2@illinois.edu; hs1@illinois.edu; czhai@illinois.edu,,"Sundaram, Hari/0000-0003-3315-6055",NSF GRFP [DGE-1144245]; NSF Research Program [IIS-1629161]; Microsoft Azure; Intel under its support program for Big Data Education,NSF GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); NSF Research Program; Microsoft Azure(Microsoft); Intel under its support program for Big Data Education,"This material is based upon work supported by the NSF GRFP under Grant Number DGE-1144245, by the NSF Research Program under Grant Number IIS-1629161, by Microsoft Azure, and by a gift fund from Intel under its support program for Big Data Education.",,14,4,4,2,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-5707-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,176,181,,10.1145/3197091.3197135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3197091.3197135,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BP2NO,,Bronze,,,10/20/2022,WOS:000543991900049,View Full Record in Web of Science

The iFields' emphasis on knowledge organization and representation provides insight into how data, used by scientists, are used to create knowledge. The iFields' disciplinary emphasis also encompasses the sociotechnical complexity of dilemmas that we found arise in research data management.

Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications. This process would benefit from embracing the pedagogy of experiential learning and involve students in open-ended explorations derived from authentic inquiries and ongoing research. On this foundation, we encourage development of flexible data science initiatives for the education of life science undergraduates within and across existing models.","[Robeva, Raina S.] Randolph Macon Coll, Dept Math, Ashland, VA 23005 USA; [Jungck, John R.] Univ Delaware, DENIN Delaware Environm Inst, Ctr Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Gross, Louis J.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Gross, Louis J.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Math, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Gross, Louis J.] Univ Tennessee, Natl Inst Math & Biol Synth, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",,"Robeva, RS (corresponding author), Randolph Macon Coll, Dept Math, Ashland, VA 23005 USA.",RainaRobeva@rmc.edu; jungck@udel.edu; lgross@utk.edu,,,"Karl Peace Fellowship in Mathematics, Randolph-Macon College, VA; NSF Award [DBI-1300426]","Karl Peace Fellowship in Mathematics, Randolph-Macon College, VA; NSF Award(National Science Foundation (NSF))","The first author was partially supported by the Karl Peace Fellowship in Mathematics, Randolph-Macon College, VA.

In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.","[Lee, Victor R.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 485 Lasuen Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wilkerson, Michelle Hoda] Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch Educ, 2121 Berkeley Way West, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lanouette, Kathryn] William & Mary, Sch Educ, 301 Monticello Ave, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",,"Lee, VR (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 485 Lasuen Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",vrlee@stanford.edu; mwilkers@berkeley.edu; lanouette@wm.edu,"Wilkerson, Michelle/GLS-6903-2022","Wilkerson, Michelle/0000-0001-8250-068X; Lanouette, Kathryn/0000-0001-9154-8386; Lee, Victor/0000-0001-6434-7589","National Science Foundation [1054280, 1541676, 1900606]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Authors Lee and Wilkerson contributed equally, jointly share lead authorship, and are listed in alphabetical order.

Herein, the authors introduce Multifaceted Rasch Measurement (MFRM) analysis and explain why MFRM must be used when judges' data are collected. The authors use data from elementary science methods students enrolled in a senior-level, semester-length course. Acting as judges, students used the 23-item Elementary Science Teaching Analysis Matrix (ESTAM) instrument to evaluate five separate science lessons taught by five different teachers. Our MFRM analysis documents that multiple judges need not act as identical robots. Rather, differences in judges' severity can be computed and corrections made in an analysis to take into consideration differing judge severity.

Many teachers' preparation for and experiences teaching statistical modeling have focused on probabilistic models. Subsequently, much of the research literature related to the teachers' understanding has focused on probabilistic models. This study explores the extent to which secondary statistics teachers appear to understand ideas of statistical modeling, specifically the processes of model building and evaluation, when introduced using classification trees, a type of algorithmic model. Results of this study suggest that while teachers were able to read and build classification tree models, they experienced more difficulty when evaluating models. Further research could continue to explore possible learning trajectories, technology tools, and pedagogical approaches for using classification trees to introduce ideas of statistical modeling.","[Zieffler, Andrew; delMas, Robert; Huberty, Michael D.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Educ Psychol, 178 Educ Sci Bldg,56 East River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Justice, Nicola] Pacific Lutheran Univ, Math Dept, Tacoma, WA 98447 USA",,"Zieffler, A (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Educ Psychol, 178 Educ Sci Bldg,56 East River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",zief0002@umn.edu,,"Zieffler, Andrew/0000-0002-1035-0341",,,,,47,2,2,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,2693-9169,,J STAT DATA SCI EDUC,J.

Results of the workshop showed that data scientists must possess a breadth of expertise across three areas - curation, analytics, and cyber-infrastructure with deep knowledge in at least one of these areas. Workshop participants also underscored the importance of domain knowledge to the success of the data science role.

These disagreements have been exacerbated by the lack of a clear single disciplinary 'parent.' Many early efforts at defining curricula and courses exist, with the EDISON Project's Data Science Frame-work (EDISON-DSF) from the European Union being the most complete. The EDISON-DSF includes both a Data Science Body of Knowledge (DS-BoK) and Competency Framework (CF-DS). This paper takes a critical look at how EDISON's CF-DS compares to recent work and other published curricular or course materials.

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers.

One promising phenomenon investigated in related work is perspective-taking. A first-person actor perspective can help facilitate group and individual sensemaking by mediating observations and actions taken by learners. Here we investigate how museum visitors made use of an actor perspective when exploring an open-ended, interactive data map museum exhibit. We use a mix of qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to explore how actor perspective-taking (APT) may mediate joint sensemaking around data visualizations. By applying interpretive coding to 54 conversations wherein APT naturalistically emerged, we identify 3 distinct self-to-data relationships constructed via APT: role-play, projection, and orientation. A further analysis explores how APT was embedded in joint sensemaking of the visualized data. Twelve APT-mediated sensemaking processes are identified; two (extrapolating and noticing absence) were used in conjunction with multiple APT self-to-data relationships, while the remaining ten (e.g., enacting, spatially characterizing, generalizing) were exclusively used with specific self-to-data APT relationships. We use these empirical findings to generate hypotheses about how APT and associated sensemaking processes may support Data Science learning goals.","[Roberts, Jessica; Lyons, Leilah] Univ Illinois, Comp Sci & Learning Sci Res Inst, Chicago, IL USA; [Lyons, Leilah] New York Hall Sci, Res Dept, Corona, NY USA; [Roberts, Jessica] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, Technol Sq Res Bldg,85 Fifth St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA",,"Roberts, J (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, Technol Sq Res Bldg,85 Fifth St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.",jessica.roberts@cc.gatech.edu,,"Roberts, Jessica/0000-0002-5961-4686",National Science Foundation [NSF INSPIRE 1248052]; National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant] [HD 51357],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant],This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [NSF INSPIRE 1248052] and the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant HD 51357].,,31,16,16,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1050-8406,1532-7809,,J LEARN SCI,J.

Initial work in a quasi-experimental setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work. Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.","[Sinha, Tanmay; Kapur, Manu] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Sinha, T (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Learning Sci & Higher Educ, RZ J 5,Clausiusstr 59, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",tanmay.sinha@gess.ethz.ch; manukapur@ethz.ch,,"Sinha, Tanmay/0000-0003-3069-2899",,,,,73,7,7,7,22,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0959-4752,1873-3263,,LEARN INSTR,Learn Instr.,OCT,2021,75,,,,,,,,101488,10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101488,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101488,,May-21,16,"Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Education & Educational Research; Psychology,TQ7WH,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,10/20/2022,WOS:000678490200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, most current assignments and projects are lacking in at least one of two ways: 1) they do not comprehensively teach all the steps involved in the complete workflow of DS projects; 2) students work on separate problems individually or in small teams, limiting the scale and impact of their solutions. To overcome these limitations, we envision novel synergistic modular assignments where a large number of students work collectively on all the tasks required to develop a large-scale DS product. The resulting product can be continuously improved with students' contributions every semester. We report our experience with developing and deploying such an assignment in an Information Retrieval course. Through the assignment, students collectively developed a search engine for finding expert faculty specializing in a given field. This shows the utility of such assignments both for teaching useful DS skills and driving innovation and research.

Yet it can be a challenge to fit the teaching of such skills into the data science curriculum. Team-Based Learning (TBL) is a pedagogical strategy that can help educators teach data science better by flipping the classroom to employ small-group collaborative learning to actively engage students in doing data science. A consequence of this teaching method is helping students achieve the workforce-relevant data science learning goals of effective communication, teamwork, and collaboration. We describe the essential elements of TBL: accountability structures and feedback mechanisms to support students collaborating within permanent teams on well-designed application exercises to do data science. The results of our case study of using TBL to teach a modern, introductory data science course indicate that the course effectively taught reproducible data science workflows, beginning R programming, and communication and collaboration. Students also reported much room for improvement in their learning of statistical thinking and advanced R concepts.

We furthermore predict that thumbnail graphics make the menu more navigable, improving lookup efficiency and performance. Our predictions are tested using SLICE N DICE, an online data wrangling tutorial platform that collects learner activity. It includes both non-programmatic and programmatic data wrangling exercises. Participants from a multi-institutional sample (n=200) were randomly assigned the tutorial either with or without thumbnail graphics. Our results show that thumbnail graphics reduce the need for clarifications, thereby assisting API lookup for novices learning data wrangling.

However, the actual techniques learners need to become proficient in are still somewhat in-construction, as the relatively new field of data science is constantly expanding to meet new data-related demands. Data science education needs to develop innovative means to keep up with this expansion that focus less on proficiency in specific techniques, but rather introduce novices to authentic data practices, and the authentic purposes directing the authentic practices. This paper focuses on a specific practice, the use of simulations to generate and examine data, in the context of authentic scientific Citizen Science research. We provide a case study of one pair of middle school students' engagement in an extended learning sequence including simulation activities inspired by authentic data practices, adapted to also be authentic for young students. While the simulation activity was inspired by the scientists' purposes, our findings illustrate four different actual purposes the students attributed to it. We also show that as the students deepened their engagement with the simulation, they gradually appropriated its intended purpose, alongside articulating more mature views of data-related concepts. The conclusions summarize the four different purposes the students expressed and identify aspects of design that contributed to the gradual re-shaping process of their actual purposes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Introducing students to data science and statistics has become essential nowadays. Students need to be introduced to authentic data practices, but also to the authentic purposes motivating these practices. Utilizing computerized simulations is a common authentic practice in science and statistics. The pedagogical, intended, use of computerized simulations can be inspired by the authentic purposes but should also be adapted to be authentic for the students. Students may have actual purposes that differ from the authentic and intended purposes. What this paper adds A case study of a pair of middle school students' engagement with a computerized simulation tool, as part of their participation in a Citizen Science project. The students expressed four actual purposes for the simulation. The students' initial purposes differed from the intended purposes, limiting their participation. Key aspects of the overall activity design ultimately supported the students to appropriate the intended purpose of the simulation and more deeply engage with the intended statistical notions. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important to consider that students may attribute purposes that differ from those of the teacher or the activity designer, to any learning activity they engage in. Making the intended purposes more explicit may be helpful, but potentially not enough for students to appropriate them. Researchers' prompts, students' freedom to reshape their use of the simulation tool and productive discussion norms can be beneficial aspects.","[Dvir, Michal] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Eilat 12, Haifa, Israel; [Ben-Zvi, Dani] Univ Haifa, Fac Educ, Haifa, Israel",,"Dvir, M (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Eilat 12, Haifa, Israel.",dvirmich@gmail.com,,,Azrieli Foundation; Israel Science Foundation [2678/17],Azrieli Foundation; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"Azrieli Foundation; Israel Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2678/17",,41,1,1,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-1013,1467-8535,,BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL,Br.

To realize the potential of big data in biomedicine, the National Institutes of Health launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative, funding several centers of excellence in biomedical data analysis and a Training Coordinating Center (TCC) tasked with facilitating online and in-person training of biomedical researchers in data science. A major initiative of the BD2K TCC is to automatically identify, describe, and organize data science training resources available on the Web and provide personalized training paths for users. In this paper, we describe the construction of ERuDIte, the Educational Resource Discovery Index for Data Science, and its release as linked data. ERuDIte contains over 11,000 training resources including courses, video tutorials, conference talks, and other materials. The metadata for these resources is described uniformly using Schema.org. We use machine learning techniques to tag each resource with concepts from the Data Science Education Ontology, which we developed to further describe resource content. Finally, we map references to people and organizations in learning resources to entities in DBpedia, DBLP, and ORCID, embedding our collection in the web of linked data. We hope that ERuDIte will provide a framework to foster open linked educational resources on the Web.","[Ambite, Jose Luis; Fierro, Lily; Burns, Gully; Mathew, Joel] USC Informat Sci Inst, 4676 Admiralty Way, Marina Del Rey, CA 90292 USA; [Gordon, Jonathan] Vassar Coll, Dept Comp Sci, 124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA",,"Ambite, JL (corresponding author), USC Informat Sci Inst, 4676 Admiralty Way, Marina Del Rey, CA 90292 USA.",ambite@isi.edu; jgordon@vassar.edu; lfierro@isi.edu; burns@isi.edu; joel@isi.edu,,,National Institutes of Health (NIH) [1U24ES026465],National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"This work is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under Grant 1U24ES026465.

This has led to a number of opinion pieces advocating for an update to the Statistics curriculum. The unifying recommendation is that computing should play a more prominent role. We strongly agree with this recommendation, but advocate the main priority is to bring applications to the forefront as proposed by Nolan and Speed in 1999. We also argue that the individuals tasked with developing data science courses should not only have statistical training, but also have experience analyzing data with the main objective of solving real-world problems. Here, we share a set of general principles and offer a detailed guide derived from our successful experience developing and teaching a graduate-level, introductory data science course centered entirely on case studies. We argue for the importance of statistical thinking, as defined by Wild and Pfannkuch in 1999 and describe how our approach teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing. This guide can also be used for statisticians wanting to gain more practical knowledge about data science before embarking on teaching an introductory course.

This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, postsecondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has the potential to improve research and learning outcomes as well as better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated cocurricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants (TAs), postdocs, instructors, and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences.","[Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A.; Konig, Stephan G.; Mazel, Florent; Oliver, David C.; McEwen, Lisa M.; Hong, Kris Y.; Hallam, Steven J.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A.; Konig, Stephan G.; Mazel, Florent; McEwen, Lisa M.; Hong, Kris Y.; Hallam, Steven J.] Univ British Columbia, ECOSCOPE, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Mazel, Florent] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Mazel, Florent] Univ British Columbia, Biodivers Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [McEwen, Lisa M.] Univ Victoria, Fac Human & Social Dev, Sch Hlth Informat Sci, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Hallam, Steven J.] Univ British Columbia, Genome Sci Ctr, Grad Program Bioinformat, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hallam, Steven J.] Univ British Columbia, Genome Sci & Technol Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hallam, Steven J.] Univ British Columbia, Life Sci Inst, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Dill-McFarland, Kimberly A.] Univ Washington, Dept Med, Div Allergy & Infect Dis, Seattle, WA USA",,"Hallam, SJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Hallam, SJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, ECOSCOPE, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Hallam, SJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Genome Sci Ctr, Grad Program Bioinformat, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Hallam, SJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Genome Sci & Technol Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Hallam, SJ (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Life Sci Inst, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",shallam@mail.ubc.ca,"Mazel, Florent/AFN-6012-2022","Mazel, Florent/0000-0003-0572-9901; Hallam, Steven/0000-0002-4889-6876; McEwen, Lisa M/0000-0002-0500-9173; Konig, Stephan/0000-0002-1597-3628",UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF); UBC Department of Microbiology and Immunology; UBC Skylight Development Grant; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Collaborative Research and Training Experience [CREATE 466096-2015],UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF); UBC Department of Microbiology and Immunology; UBC Skylight Development Grant; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Collaborative Research and Training Experience(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This work was performed under the auspices of the UBC Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF https://tlef.ubc.ca) (SJH), UBC Department of Microbiology and Immunology (https://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/) (SJH), UBC Skylight Development Grant (https://skylight.science.ubc.ca/grants/skylight) (KADM), and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE 466096-2015) ECOSCOPE training program (SJH).

The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DLbased methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well.","[Shen, Chaopeng; Fang, Kuai; Tsai, Wen-Ping] Penn State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Laloy, Eric] Inst Environm, Inst Environm Hlth & Safety, Mol, Belgium; [Elshorbagy, Amin] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Civil Geol & Environm Engn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Albert, Adrian] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Natl Energy Res Supercomp Ctr, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Bales, Jerad] CUAHSI, Cambridge, MA USA; [Chang, Fi-John] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Ganguly, Sangram] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, BAER Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Hsu, Kuo-Lin] Univ Calif Irvine, Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Kifer, Daniel] Penn State Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fang, Zheng; Li, Dongfeng] Univ Texas Arlington, Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76013 USA; [Li, Xiaodong] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Shen, CP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",cshen@engr.psu.edu,"li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; Elshorbagy, Amin/A-6274-2015; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022; Hsu, Kuolin/E-6120-2019","Elshorbagy, Amin/0000-0002-5740-8029; HSU, KUOLIN/0000-0002-3578-3565; Tsai, Wen-Ping/0000-0002-5315-1668; Kifer, Daniel/0000-0002-4611-7066; Chang, Fi-John/0000-0002-1655-8573","U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0016605]; U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-1832294]; Canadian NSERC-DG [403047]; Key RAMP;D projects of the Science and Technology department in Sichuan Province [2018SZ0343]; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University; NSF [CCF-1317560, EAR-1338606]; Belgian Nuclear Research Centre","U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Canadian NSERC-DG; Key RAMP;D projects of the Science and Technology department in Sichuan Province; State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, Sichuan University(Sichuan University); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Belgian Nuclear Research Centre","We thank Matthew McCabe, Keith Sawicz, and an anonymous reviewer for their valuable comments, which helped to improve the paper.

While machine learning allows to build powerful predicting tools, it hasn't been used sufficiently to detect biases rooted in gender and race in educational material. Hence, using effective machine learning techniques we aim to enhance the success rate of undergraduate students in Data Science education and programs while promoting engagement through identifying and mitigating potential gender and racial biases. To this end, we propose a novel bias detection approach which uses a combination of gender identification and sentiment classification for characterization of gender and race in educational contents.

Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways.

However, many ITS rely heavily on expert design and hand-crafted rules. This makes them difficult to build and transfer across domains and limits their potential efficacy. In this paper, we investigate how feedback in a large-scale ITS can be automatically generated in a data-driven way, and more specifically how personalization of feedback can lead to improvements in student performance outcomes. First, in this paper we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We leverage state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide students with personalized feedback using hints and Wikipedia-based explanations. Second, we demonstrate that personalized feedback leads to improved success rates at solving exercises in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Korbit, a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with around 20,000 students launched in 2019. We present the results of experiments with students and show that the automated, data-driven, personalized feedback leads to a significant overall improvement of 22.95% in student performance outcomes and substantial improvements in the subjective evaluation of the feedback.","[Kochmar, Ekaterina; Vu, Dung Do; Belfer, Robert; Gupta, Varun; Serban, Iulian Vlad; Pineau, Joelle] Korbit Technol Inc, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Kochmar, Ekaterina] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England; [Vu, Dung Do] Ecole Technol Super, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Pineau, Joelle] McGill Univ, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Pineau, Joelle] MILA Quebec Artificial Intelligence Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",,"Kochmar, E (corresponding author), Korbit Technol Inc, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.;Kochmar, E (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England.",ekaterina@korbit.ai,,"Kochmar, Ekaterina/0000-0003-3328-1374",,,,,88,0,0,3,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1560-4292,1560-4306,,INT J ARTIF INTELL E,Int.

Current pedagogy has focused either on data science or on purely analytic technical aspects. There is therefore, an opportunity to rethink how institutions can develop innovative data-focussed education programmes, addressing both modern industry and community demands. As both academia and industry strive to integrate applied learning, transferable and enterprise skills into business and sciences, this paper proposes a design based research approach (DBR) for designing such a new interdisciplinary data science teaching curriculum as a foundation to deliver business undergraduate degrees in Business Data Science. Adopting a design science method our proposed DBR illustrates effective utilities for conceptualising and evaluating a fully functional new degree programme - Bachelor of Business Data Science. Ten senior business information systems academics and five analytics industry practitioners in Victoria, Australia were interviewed in three iterative prototyping phases followed by a final focus group session with business information systems students that evaluated the proposed structure. The findings suggest that proposed DBR ensures the design of an innovative data science degree that may meet growing industry and interdisciplinary demands.

In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19. We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations, beyond this set of examples.","[Rubel, Laurie H.] Univ Haifa, Dept Math Educ, Haifa, Israel; [Nicol, Cynthia] Univ British Columbia, Dept Curriculum & Pedag, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Chronaki, Anna] Univ Thessaly, Volos, Greece; [Chronaki, Anna] Malmo Univ, Malmo, Sweden",,"Rubel, LH (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Dept Math Educ, Haifa, Israel.",LRubel@edu.haifa.ac.il; cynthia.nicol@ubc.ca; Anna.chronaki@mau.se,,"Chronaki, Anna/0000-0002-7150-9387",,,,,67,2,2,6,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-1954,1573-0816,,EDUC STUD MATH,Educ.

Project-based learning (PBL) is a well-known pedagogical tool for interdisciplinary education. In order to successfully accomplish interdisciplinary learning, students must have sufficient knowledge in each of the separate disciplines. Use of cross-disciplinary teams, for example, is one way to make sure a project team includes specialists in all required disciplines. This, however, is not always the case. In many cases, there are significant knowledge gaps within the project team in one or more of the project domains. Specifically, in our case, fourth-year electrical engineering students are working in pairs on biomedical signal processing projects, which are evidently interdisciplinary in nature. The teams, however, are homogeneous and the students lack the essential medical expertise required to achieve solutions applicable by physicians. Furthermore, students tend to acknowledge this gap only in the advanced phases of the project, and so critical phases, such as goal setting and planning, are performed without the required knowledge. In this article, we present (a) data that supports the existence of this knowledge gap and its effect on students; (b) an intervention program that exposes students to both the required domain knowledge and its importance to their work; and (c) initial data that supports the success of this intervention program in bridging these gaps.","[Mike, Koby; Hazzan, Orit] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Haifa, Israel; [Nemirovsky-Rotman, Shira] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Elect Engn, Haifa, Israel",,"Mike, K (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, Haifa, Israel.",mike@campus.technion.ac.il; nshira@campus.technion.ac.il; oritha@technion.ac.il,,,Bernard M.

The model of the quantified self-in which data about one's own activities are collected and made into objects of study-provides inspiration for one such approach. By drawing on what one already knows about their self and their prior experiences, it may be possible to bootstrap students' abilities to interpret and make sense of data. Taking that possibility seriously, this article describes some of the gains observed in students' statistical reasoning following a quantified self, wearables-based elementary statistics unit and provides a theoretical framework drawing from cognitive psychology, embodiment, and situative perspectives to characterize how prior experience is used as a resource in data sense-making when the data are about students' own physical experiences. This framework centralizes and interrogates the work of remembering prior experiences and articulates how remembering is involved in interpreting quantified self data. Specifically, the framework emphasizes that remembering in service of data interpretation is a reconstructive act that draws from both general and specific embodied resources and that the work of reconstructive remembering in the classroom is both individual and multi-participant work. To demonstrate measured learning gains and illustrate the framework, written assessment results and descriptive cases of student and teacher discussions about quantified self data from two sixth-grade classes participating in a classroom design experiment are provided.

This paper presents a highly innovative course in a UK university that introduces undergraduate medical students to data science. It also discusses a study on student perspectives on the learning and teaching of health data science.Methods: The pedagogical design elements of the Data Science in Medicine course are discussed, along with its syllabus, assessment methodology and flipped classroom delivery. The course has been offered to approximately 630 students over three years. Student perspectives were investigated through three focus groups with the participation of 19 students across different study years in medicine. An experiment was conducted regarding instructor-led vs. video-based modalities of online programming labs, with the participation of 8 students.Results: The course has led to improved data competency among medical students and to a positive change in their opinions about data science. Motivating the course and showing relevance to clinical practice was one of the biggest challenges. Statistics was perceived by focus group participants as an essential data skill. Including data science in the medical curriculum was perceived as important by Year 1 students, while opinions varied between Year 4/5 participants. Video-based online labs were preferred over instructor-led online labs, and they were found to be more useful and enjoyable, without leading to any significant difference in academic performance. Conclusions: Teaching data science to undergraduate medicine students is highly desirable and feasible. We recommend including statistics in the curriculum and practical skill development through simple and clinicallyrelevant data science tasks, supported through video-based online labs. Further reporting on similar courses is needed, as well as larger-scale studies on student perspectives.","[Doudesis, Dimitrios] Univ Edinburgh, BHF Ctr Cardiovasc Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Doudesis, Dimitrios] Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Manataki, Areti] Univ St Andrews, Sch Comp Sci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",,"Manataki, A (corresponding author), Sch Comp Sci, Jack Cole Bldg, St Andrews KY16 9SX, Fife, Scotland.",D.Doudesis@ed.ac.uk; A.Manataki@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Doudesis, Dimitrios/0000-0001-6699-9476; Manataki, Areti/0000-0003-3698-8535",,,,,24,0,0,0,1,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",1386-5056,1872-8243,,INT J MED INFORM,Int.

Hence, it is necessary to design efficient education techniques to rapidly train the next generation of students. We describe a holistic approach that integrates multiple objectives within a single semester course taught at the first year level. The objectives include basic data processing techniques, statistical analysis, teamwork, and project management. We conducted a project that combined different public datasets related to the cost and quality of education in the US. Students demonstrated a high degree of involvement in this exercise as they were curious to explore data that related to their own college selection process. It is well known that it is difficult to perform a cost-quality analysis in the field of college education. We used college ranking data created by the Wall Street Journal, and combined it with data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database (https://nces.ed.goviipeds/) that provided college costs and graduation data. Students worked in teams to download sections of the data from multiple sources, performed cleaning and verification, and merged the data for analysis. This taught them the values of teamwork, goal-setting, and process measurement for timely project completion. We determined that the Pearson correlation between the rank of a college and in-state tuition was -0.65 (p<0.005) for private colleges, and -0.34 (p<0.005) for public colleges. This indicates that higher ranked colleges tend to charge higher tuition. The Pearson correlation between the rank of all colleges and their graduation rates is -0.75 (p<0.005), and between rank and retention rates is -0.71 (p<0.005). Private college tuition is typically $40,000 annually, whereas public colleges cost $20,000. These figures suggest that public colleges provide good value. This has policy implications for government funding of education.","[Rao, A.

This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective? Findings The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. Originality/value The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals.","[Virkus, Sirje] Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Garoufallou, Emmanouel] Alexander Technol Educ Inst Thessaloniki, Dept Lib Sci & Informat Syst, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Garoufallou, Emmanouel] Deltos Grp, Thessaloniki, Greece",,"Virkus, S (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ, Sch Digital Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",sirje.virkus@tlu.ee,,,,,,,84,16,17,20,146,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2514-9288,2514-9318,,DATA TECHNOL APPL,Data Technol.
