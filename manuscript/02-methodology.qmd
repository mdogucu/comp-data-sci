### Systematic Literature Review

Systematic literature review is generally used for informing evidence-based decisions in a field by compiling all empirical evidence that fits pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria (@evans2001systematic; @liberati2009prisma). 
This approach was selected within the context of the study because we aimed to (1) specify current evidence and knowledge gaps in undergraduate data science education and (2) inform policymakers and data science educators/practitioners about the present status of data science education. 
We chose to employ a qualitative research design to gain a deeper understanding and inform possible further quantitative meta-analysis topics that can be conducted in this field.

The target population of this literature review was publications on data science education that directly address the undergraduate level.
Due to variations in terminology, keywords, and language used by teacher-scholars across different data science fields, identifying the entire target population was not feasible.
Since there is no consensus on what data science is, and consequently what data science education is, we did not evaluate whether publications met a certain definition of data science.
Rather, we considered publications that self-proclaim to focus on data science education.
Therefore, we opted to identify the accessible population for this study as publications that included “data science education” in quotes in the title, abstract, or keywords.

![Flowchart of data collection and analysis. Publications were collected in December 2022.](methods-diagram/methods-diagram.png){#fig-flowchart}

@fig-flowchart summarizes the stages of our data collection and analysis processes which led to the sample of this study.
As shown in the diagram, we extracted data from six databases that potentially include publications on data science education.
These databases were: (1) ERIC ProQuest, (2) IEEE Xplore, (3) PubMed, (4) ScienceDirect, (5) Scopus, and (6) Web of Science.
These databases were selected because they cover a large number of publications and they include multiple disciplines that are commonly linked to data science education.
For instance, ERIC ProQuest is known to mainly include education-focused publications, IEEE Xplore focuses on engineering and Web of Science is multidisciplinary-focused.

From the selected databases, we collected publications including the term "data science education" (in quotes) in at least one of the following fields: title, abstract, keywords.
We acknowledge that there are many other combinations of search terms that could result in publications related to data science education, including terms such as "data science courses", "data science pedagogy", "data science curriculum".
One can generate numerous similar terms, with or without quotes.
We specifically used the term "data science education" for its broadness and to set the scope of the research.
We did not use "data science" and "education" separately to avoid publications in education that employ data science methods for their analyses.

Across the six databases, we found a total of `r nrow(all_reviews)` publications that met our search criteria.
We extracted some variables including, but not limited to: author names; publication title; publication venue (e.g., journal title or conference title).
We conducted the initial database search in December 2022, resulting in a pool of publications that were either published by that date or available online by that date but officially published in 2023.

The data analysis was conducted in two stages: 1) preliminary data analysis and 2) in-depth data analysis.
Each publication was randomly assigned to two authors of the present manuscript.
At both data-analysis stages, the two assigned reviewers first examined each publication independently and then discussed discrepancies between their analysis decisions, to reach a consensus.
In cases where conflicts persisted, the entire group of five authors deliberated on the final decision.

During preliminary data analysis, we manually opened and read the abstracts of all publications.
At this stage, we sought to exclude publications that did not meet our format and content criteria based on their abstracts.
Specifically, we aimed to include journal/conference/magazine articles and book chapters (*format*) that focused on undergraduate data science education (*content*) and were written in English.
During in-depth analysis we examined the full publications and, upon confirming that they met our inclusion criteria, we recorded variables of potential interest.
The number of publications that were excluded due to format, content or other reason, at each stage of our analysis, is shown in @fig-flowchart.

  n_docs_reviewed = nrow(all_reviews),

    sum(),

    filter(str_detect(broad_reason, "Content")) |> 
    pull(total) |> 
    sum(),  
  n_docs_graduate = why_not_keep |> 
    filter(str_detect(reason, "graduate")) |> 
    pull(total) |> 
    sum(),
  n_docs_k_12 = why_not_keep |> 
    filter(str_detect(reason, "K-12")) |> 
    pull(total) |> 
    sum(),
  n_docs_non_academic = why_not_keep |> 
    filter(str_detect(reason, "adults")) |> 
    pull(total) |> 
    sum(),
  n_not_ds_ed = why_not_keep |> 
    filter(str_detect(reason, "Not about")) |> 
    pull(total) |> 
    sum(),
  n_other = summary_exclusion |> 
    filter(str_detect(broad_reason, "Other")) |> 
    pull(total) |> 
    sum()
) 
```

Across both stages, we excluded `r excluded$n_docs_excluded_format` publications due to formatting (which included posters, panels, letters to journal editors and meeting highlights).
Of the remaining `r excluded$n_docs_reviewed - excluded$n_docs_excluded_format` publications, `r excluded$n_docs_excluded_content` were excluded due to their content: `r excluded$n_not_ds_ed` of them were not about data science education (including e.g. publications focused on data science methodology) and `r excluded$n_docs_excluded_content - excluded$n_not_ds_ed` of them focused exclusively on a different level of education than undergraduate.
Among the latter excluded group, `r excluded$n_docs_graduate` publications focused on graduate level, `r excluded$n_docs_k_12` focused on K-12, middle school or high school and `r excluded$n_docs_non_academic` publications focused on data science education for adults in non-academic programs (including, e.g. practitioners, citizen science and instructors).
Publications that focused on both undergraduate and non-undergraduate levels were included.
Of the remaining `r excluded$n_docs_reviewed - excluded$n_docs_excluded_format - excluded$n_docs_excluded_content` publications, other `r excluded$n_other` were excluded due to being: not written in English; duplicated in our dataset; retracted by their authors.

After excluding publications for the reasons detailed above, we were left with `r excluded$n_docs_kept` publications, which we analyzed in-depth.
In addition to the variables extracted from databases (e.g. title of the publication, author names, etc.) for each publication we collected data on:

-   affiliation country of researchers

<!-- -->

-   open access status (i.e. whether the full publication is accessible for free from a Google Scholar search)

-   year when the publication was first published online

-   document type (conference article, journal article, magazine article or book chapter)

-   whether there were explicit research questions stated in the publication

-   whether there was any reporting of data collection in the publication and, if data were collected, the type of data (quantitative, qualitative or mixed)

-   publication focus, that is a categorization of the subject matter of the publication (for example "pedagogical approach", "class activity" or "review of current state of data science education")

-   discipline of the publishing source, determined by examining the call for contributions of the journal or conference, or the description of the book or magazine ("broad" when the publishing source called for contributions across all data science fields, otherwise a specific sub-field of data science, e.g. "computer science" or "statistics")

-   the discipline of the target audience, as expressed by the authors in the publication ("broad" when the publication target were all data science educators, otherwise a specific sub-field of data science, e.g. "computer science" or "statistics")

### Validity and Reliability Evidences of the Study

Several evidences of validity and reliability are collected in systematic literature review studies to ascertain whether a study measures what they intended to measure and to enhance the reproducibility of the research findings.
Accordingly, we collected evidences to increase the validity and reliability of this study.

In terms of dependability, we recorded our research steps such as how data were collected, how categories were derived and how we made decisions throughout the research study as suggested by @merriam2015qualitative. 
In terms of ensuring transferability of this research, we provided a rich, _thick description_ (@merriam2015qualitative) of the data collection,data wrangling and data analysis procedures in the repository which has open access to every reader who wish to examine closely or reproducing the data analysis.
We also ensured _maximum variation_ by including different undergraduate data science education studies conducted in different fields and/or included different content areas.
This enabled us to explore the variations (@merriam2015qualitative) among the undergraduate data science education practices.
